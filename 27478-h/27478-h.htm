  <p><b>AUSTRIA, LOWER</b> (Ger. <i>Niederösterreich</i> or <i>Österreich
  unter der Enns</i>, "Austria below the river Enns"), an archduchy and
  crownland of Austria, bounded E. by Hungary, N. by Bohemia and Moravia,
  W. by Bohemia and Upper Austria, and S. by Styria. It has an area of 7654
  sq. m. and is divided into two parts by the Danube, which enters at its
  most westerly point, and leaves it at its eastern extremity, near
  Pressburg. North of this line is the low hilly country, known as the
  <i>Waldviertel</i>, which lies at the foot and forms the continuation of
  the Bohemian and Moravian plateau. Towards the W. it attains in the
  Weinsberger Wald, of which the highest point is the Peilstein, an
  altitude of 3478 ft., and descends towards the valley of the Danube
  through the Gföhler Wald (2368 ft.) and the Manhartsgebirge (1758 ft.).
  Its most south-easterly offshoots are formed by the Bisamberg (1180 ft.),
  near Vienna, just opposite the Kahlenberg. The southern division of the
  province is, in the main, mountainous and hilly, and is occupied by the
  Lower Austrian Alps and their offshoots. The principal groups are: the
  Voralpe (5802 ft.), the Dürrenstein (6156 ft.), the Ötscher (6205 ft.),
  the Raxalpe (6589 ft.) and the Schneeberg (6806 ft.), which is the
  highest summit in the whole province. To the E. of the famous ridge of
  Semmering are the groups of the Wechsel (5700 ft.) and the Leithagebirge
  (1674 ft.). The offshoots of the Alpine group are formed by the Wiener
  Wald, which attains an altitude of 2929 ft. in the Schöpfl and ends N.W.
  of Vienna in the Kahlenberg (1404 ft.) and Leopoldsberg (1380 ft.).</p>

  <p>Lower Austria belongs to the watershed of the Danube, which with the
  exception of the Lainsitz, which is a tributary of the Moldau, receives
  all the other rivers of the province. Its principal affluents on the
  right are: the Enns, Ybbs, Erlauf, Pielach, Traisen, Wien, Schwechat,
  Fischa and Leitha; on the left the Isper, Krems, Kamp, Göllersau and the
  March. Besides the Danube, only the Enns and the March are navigable
  rivers. Amongst the small Alpine lakes, the Erlaufsee and the Lunzer See
  are worth mentioning. Of its mineral springs, the best known are the
  sulphur springs of Baden, the iodine springs of Deutsch-Altenburg, the
  iron springs of Pyrawarth, and the thermal springs of Vöslau. In general
  the climate, which varies with the configuration of the surface, is
  moderate and healthy, although subject to rapid changes of temperature.
  Although 43.4% of the total area is arable land, the soil is only of
  moderate fertility and does not satisfy the wants of this
  thickly-populated province. Woods occupy 34.2%, gardens and meadows 13.1%
  and pastures 3.2%. Vineyards occupy 2% of the total area and produce a
  good wine, specially those on the sunny slopes of the Wiener Wald.
  Cattle-rearing is not well developed, but game and fish are plentiful.
  Mining is only of slight importance, small quantities of coal and
  iron-ore being extracted in the Alpine foothill region; graphite is found
  near Mühldorf. From an industrial point of view, Lower Austria stands,
  together with Bohemia and Moravia, in the front rank amongst the Austrian
  provinces. The centre of its great industrial activity is the capital,
  Vienna (<i>q.v.</i>); but in the region of the Wiener Wald up to the
  Semmering, owing to its many waters, which can be transformed into motive
  power, many factories are spread. The principal industries are, the
  metallurgic and textile industries in all their branches, milling,
  brewing and chemicals; paper, leather and silk; cloth, <i>objets de
  luxe</i> and millinery; physical and musical instruments; sugar, tobacco
  factories and foodstuffs. The very extensive commerce of the province has
  also its centre in Vienna. The population of Lower Austria in 1900 was
  3,100,493, which corresponds to 405 inhabitants per sq. m. It is,
  therefore, the most densely populated province of Austria. According to
  the language in common use, 95% of the population <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[v.03 p.0002]</span>was German, 4.66%
  was Czech, and the remainder was composed of Poles, Slovaks, Ruthenians,
  Croatians and Italians. According to religion 92.47% of the inhabitants
  were Roman Catholics; 5.07% were Jews; 2.11% were Protestants and the
  remainder belonged to the Greek church. In the matter of education, Lower
  Austria is one of the most advanced provinces of Austria, and 99.8% of
  the children of school-going age attended school regularly in 1900. The
  local diet is composed of 78 members, of which the archbishop of Vienna,
  the bishop of St Pölten and the rector of the Vienna University are
  members <i>ex officio</i>. Lower Austria sends 64 members, to the
  Imperial Reichsrat at Vienna. For administrative purposes, the province
  is divided into 22 districts and three towns with autonomous
  municipalities: Vienna (1,662,269), the capital (since 1905 including
  Floridsdorf, 36,599), Wiener-Neustadt (28,438) and Waidhofen on the Ybbs
  (4447). Other principal towns are: Baden (12,447), Bruck on the Leitha
  (5134), Schwechat (8241), Korneuburg (8298), Stokerau (10,213), Krems
  (12,657), Mödling (15,304), Reichenau (7457), Neunkirchen (10,831), St
  Pölten (14,510) and Klosterneuburg (11,595).</p>

  <p>The original archduchy, which included Upper Austria, is the nucleus
  of the Austrian empire, and the oldest possession of the house of
  Habsburg in its present dominions.</p>

  <p><b>AUSTRIA, UPPER</b> (Ger. <i>Oberösterreich</i> or <i>Österreich ob
  der Enns</i>, "Austria above the river Enns"), an archduchy and
  crown-land of Austria, bounded N. by Bohemia, W. by Bavaria, S. by
  Salzburg and Styria, and E. by Lower Austria. It has an area of 4631 sq.
  m. Upper Austria is divided by the Danube into two unequal parts. Its
  smaller northern part is a prolongation of the southern angle of the
  Bohemian forest and contains as culminating points the Plöcklstein (4510
  ft.) and the Sternstein (3690 ft.). The southern part belongs to the
  region of the Eastern Alps, containing the Salzkammergut and Upper
  Austrian Alps, which are found principally in the district of
  Salzkammergut (<i>q.v.</i>). To the north of these mountains, stretching
  towards the Danube, is the Alpine foothill region, composed partly of
  terraces and partly of swelling undulations, of which the most important
  is the Hausruckwald. This is a wooded chain of mountains, with many
  branches, rich in brown coal and culminating in the Göblberg (2950 ft.).
  Upper Austria belongs to the watershed of the Danube, which flows through
  it from west to east, and receives here on the right the Inn with the
  Salzach, the Traun, the Enns with the Steyr and on its left the Great and
  Little Mühl rivers. The Schwarzenberg canal between the Great Mühl and
  the Moldau establishes a direct navigable route between the Danube and
  the Elbe. The climate of Upper Austria, which varies according to the
  altitude, is on the whole moderate; it is somewhat severe in the north,
  but is mild in Salzkammergut. The population of the duchy in 1900 was
  809,918, which is equivalent to 174.8 inhabitants per sq. m. It has the
  greatest density of population of any of the Alpine provinces. The
  inhabitants are almost exclusively of German stock and Roman Catholics.
  For administrative purposes, Upper Austria is divided into two autonomous
  municipalities, Linz (58,778) the capital, and Steyr (17,592) and 12
  districts. Other principal towns are Wels (12,187), Ischl (9646) and
  Gmunden (7126). The local diet, of which the bishop of Linz is a member
  <i>ex officio</i>, is composed of 50 members and the duchy sends 22
  members to the Reichsrat at Vienna. The soil in the valleys and on the
  lower slopes of the hills is fertile, indeed 35.08% of the whole area is
  arable. Agriculture is well developed and relatively large quantities of
  the principal cereals are produced. Upper Austria has the largest
  proportion of meadows in all Austria, 18.54%, while 2.49% is lowland and
  Alpine pasturage. Of the remainder, woods occupy 34.02%, gardens 1.99%
  and 4.93% is unproductive. Cattle-breeding is also in a very advanced
  stage and together with the timber-trade forms a considerable resource of
  the province. The principal mineral wealth of Upper Austria is salt, of
  which it extracts nearly 50% of the total Austrian production. Other
  important products are lignite, gypsum and a variety of valuable stones
  and clays. There are about thirty mineral springs, the best known being
  the salt baths of Ischl and the iodine waters at Hall. The principal
  industries are the iron and metal manufactures, chiefly centred at Steyr.
  Next in importance are the machine, linen, cotton and paper manufactures,
  the milling, brewing and distilling industries and shipbuilding. The
  principal articles of export are salt, stone, timber, live-stock, woollen
  and iron wares and paper.</p>

  <p><b>AUSTRIA-HUNGARY,</b> or the <span class="sc">Austro-Hungarian
  Monarchy</span> (Ger. <i>Österreichisch-ungarische Monarchie</i> or
  <i>Österreichisch-ungarisches Reich</i>), the official name of a country
  situated in central Europe, bounded E. by Russia and Rumania, S. by
  Rumania, Servia, Turkey and Montenegro, W. by the Adriatic Sea, Italy,
  Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the German Empire, and N. by the German
  Empire and Russia. It occupies about the sixteenth part of the total area
  of Europe, with an area (1905) of 239,977 sq. m. The monarchy consists of
  two independent states: the kingdoms and lands represented in the council
  of the empire (<i>Reichsrat</i>), unofficially called Austria
  (<i>q.v.</i>) or Cisleithania; and the "lands of St Stephen's Crown,"
  unofficially called Hungary (<i>q.v.</i>) or Transleithania. It received
  its actual name by the diploma of the emperor Francis Joseph I. of the
  14th of November 1868, replacing the name of the Austrian Empire under
  which the dominions under his sceptre were formerly known. The
  Austro-Hungarian monarchy is very often called unofficially the Dual
  Monarchy. It had in 1901 a population of 45,405,267 inhabitants,
  comprising therefore within its borders, about one-eighth of the total
  population of Europe. By the Berlin Treaty of 1878 the principalities of
  Bosnia and Herzegovina with an area of 19,702 sq. m., and a population
  (1895) of 1,591,036 inhabitants, owning Turkey as suzerain, were placed
  under the administration of Austria-Hungary, and their annexation in 1908
  was recognized by the Powers in 1909, so that they became part of the
  dominions of the monarchy.</p>

  <p><i>Government</i>.&mdash;The present constitution of the
  Austro-Hungarian monarchy (see <span class="sc">Austria</span>) is based
  on the Pragmatic Sanction of the emperor Charles VI., first promulgated
  on the 19th of April 1713, whereby the succession to the throne is
  settled in the dynasty of Habsburg-Lorraine, descending by right of
  primogeniture and lineal succession to male heirs, and, in case of their
  extinction, to the female line, and whereby the indissolubility and
  indivisibility of the monarchy are determined; is based, further, on the
  diploma of the emperor Francis Joseph I. of the 20th of October 1860,
  whereby the constitutional form of government is introduced; and, lastly,
  on the so-called <i>Ausgleich</i> or "Compromise," concluded on the 8th
  of February 1867, whereby the relations between Austria and Hungary were
  regulated.</p>

  <p>The two separate states&mdash;Austria and Hungary&mdash;are completely
  independent of each other, and each has its own parliament and its own
  government. The unity of the monarchy is expressed in the common head of
  the state, who bears the title Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of
  Hungary, and in the common administration of a series of affairs, which
  affect both halves of the Dual Monarchy. These are: (1) foreign affairs,
  including diplomatic and consular representation abroad; (2) the army,
  including the navy, but excluding the annual voting of recruits, and the
  special army of each state; (3) finance in so far as it concerns joint
  expenditure.</p>

  <p>For the administration of these common affairs there are three joint
  ministries: the ministry of foreign affairs and of the imperial and royal
  house, the ministry of war, and the ministry of finance. It must be noted
  that the authority of the joint ministers is restricted to common
  affairs, and that they are not allowed to direct or exercise any
  influence on affairs of government affecting separately one of the halves
  of the monarchy. <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>[v.03 p.0003]</span>The minister of foreign affairs
  conducts the international relations of the Dual Monarchy, and can
  conclude international treaties. But commercial treaties, and such state
  treaties as impose burdens on the state, or parts of the state, or
  involve a change of territory, require the parliamentary assent of both
  states. The minister of war is the head for the administration of all
  military affairs, except those of the Austrian <i>Landwehr</i> and of the
  Hungarian <i>Honveds</i>, which are committed to the ministries for
  national defence of the two respective states. But the supreme command of
  the army is vested in the monarch, who has the power to take all measures
  regarding the whole army. It follows, therefore, that the total armed
  power of the Dual Monarchy forms a whole under the supreme command of the
  sovereign. The minister of finance has charge of the finances of common
  affairs, prepares the joint budget, and administers the joint state debt.
  (Till 1909 the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were also administered
  by the joint minister of finance, excepting matters exclusively dependent
  on the minister of war.) For the control of the common finances, there is
  appointed a joint supreme court of accounts, which audits the accounts of
  the joint ministries.</p>

  <p><i>Budget</i>.&mdash;Side by side with the budget of each state of the
  Dual Monarchy, there is a common budget, which comprises the expenditure
  necessary for the common affairs, namely for the conduct of foreign
  affairs, for the army, and for the ministry of finance. The revenues of
  the joint budget consist of the revenues of the joint ministries, the net
  proceeds of the customs, and the quota, or the proportional contributions
  of the two states. This quota is fixed for a period of years, and
  generally coincides with the duration of the customs and commercial
  treaty. Until 1897 Austria contributed 70%, and Hungary 30% of the joint
  expenditure, remaining after-deduction of the common revenue. It was then
  decided that from 1897 to July 1907 the quota should be 66-46/49 for
  Austria, and 33-2/49 for Hungary. In 1907 Hungary's contribution was
  raised to 36.4%. Of the total charges 2% is first of all debited to
  Hungary on account of the incorporation with this state of the former
  military frontier.</p>

  <p>The Budget estimates for the common administration were as follows in
  1905:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Delegations</i>.&mdash;The constitutional right of voting money
  applicable to the common affairs and of its political control is
  exercised by the Delegations, which consist each of sixty members, chosen
  for one year, one-third of them by the Austrian Herrenhaus (Upper House)
  and the Hungarian Table of Magnates (Upper House), and two-thirds of them
  by the Austrian and the Hungarian Houses of Representatives. The
  delegations are annually summoned by the monarch alternately to Vienna
  and to Budapest. Each delegation has its separate sittings, both alike
  public. Their decisions are reciprocally communicated in writing, and, in
  case of non-agreement, their deliberations are renewed. Should three such
  interchanges be made without agreement, a common plenary sitting is held
  of an equal number of both delegations; and these collectively, without
  discussion, decide the question by common vote. The common decisions of
  both houses require for their validity the sanction of the monarch. Each
  delegation has the right to formulate resolutions independently, and to
  call to account and arraign the common ministers. In the exercise of
  their office the members of both delegations are irresponsible, enjoying
  constitutional immunity.</p>

  <p><i>Army</i>.&mdash;The military system of the Austro-Hungarian
  monarchy is similar in both states, and rests since 1868 upon the
  principle of the universal and personal obligation of the citizen to bear
  arms. Its military force is composed of the common army (<i>K. und
  K.</i>); the special armies, namely the Austrian (<i>K.K.</i>)
  <i>Landwehr</i>, and the Hungarian <i>Honveds</i>, which are separate
  national institutions, and the <i>Landsturm</i> or levy-in-mass. As
  stated above, the common army stands under the administration of the
  joint minister of war, while the special armies are under the
  administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The
  yearly contingent of recruits for the army is fixed by the military bills
  voted by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, and is generally
  determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census
  returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished
  59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men are annually allotted
  to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honveds. The term
  of service is 2 years (3 years in the cavalry) with the colours, 7 or 8
  in the reserve and 2 in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to
  the active army the same total period of service is spent in various
  special reserves.</p>

  <p>For the military and administrative service of the army the Dual
  Monarchy is divided into 16 military territorial districts (15 of which
  correspond to the 15 army corps) and 108 supplementary districts (105 for
  the army, and 3 for the navy). In 1902, since which year no material
  change was made in the formal organization of the army, there were 5
  cavalry divisions and 31 infantry divisions, formed in 15 army corps,
  which are located as follows:&mdash;I. Cracow, II. Vienna, III. Graz, IV.
  Budapest, V. Pressburg, VI. Kaschau, VII. Temesvár, VIII. Prague, IX.
  Josefstadt, X. Przemysl, XI. Lemberg, XII. Herrmannstadt, XIII. Agram,
  XIV. Innsbruck, XV. Serajewo. In addition there is the military district
  of Zara. The usual strength of the corps is, 2 infantry divisions (4
  brigades, 8 or 9 regiments, 32 or 36 battalions), 1 cavalry brigade (18
  squadrons), and 1 artillery brigade (16-18 batteries or 128-144
  field-guns), besides technical and departmental units and in some cases
  fortress artillery regiments. The infantry is organized into line
  regiments, Jäger and Tirolese regiments, the cavalry into dragoons,
  lancers, Uhlans and hussars, the artillery into regiments. The Austrian
  <i>Landwehr</i> (which retains the old designation <i>K.K.</i>, formerly
  <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[v.03
  p.0004]</span>applied to the Austrian regular army) is organized in 8
  divisions of varying strength, the "Royal Hungarian" Landwehr or Honveds
  in 7 divisions, both Austrian and Hungarian Landwehr having in addition
  cavalry (Uhlans and hussars) and artillery. It is probable that a
  Landwehr or Honveds division will, in war, form part of each army corps
  except in the case of the Vienna corps, which has 3 divisions in peace.
  The remaining men of military age (up to 42) as usual form the
  <i>Landsturm</i>. It is to be noted that this Landsturm comprises many
  men who would elsewhere be classed as Landwehr.</p>

  <p>The strength of the Austro-Hungarian army on a peace footing was as

  <p>The troops stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1905 (376 officers
  and 6372 men) are included in the total for the common army.</p>

  <p>The peace strength of the active army in combatants is thus about
  350,000 officers and men, inclusive of the two Landwehrs and of the
  Austrian "K.K." guards, the Hungarian crown guards, the gendarmerie,
  &amp;c. The numbers of the Landsturm and the war strength of the whole
  armed forces are not published. It is estimated that the first line army
  in war would consist of 460,000 infantry, 49,000 cavalry, 78,000
  artillery, 21,000 engineers, &amp;c., beside train and non-combatant
  soldiers. The Landwehr and Honved would yield 219,000 infantry and 18,000
  cavalry, and other reserves 223,000 men. These figures give an
  approximate total strength of 1,147,000, not inclusive of Landsturm.</p>

  <p><i>Fortifications.</i>&mdash;The principal fortifications in
  Austria-Hungary are: Cracow and Przemysl in Galicia; Komárom, the centre
  of the inland fortifications, Pétervárad, Ó-Arad and Temesvár in Hungary;
  Serajewo, Mostar and Bilek in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Alpine frontiers,
  especially those in Tirol, have numerous fortifications, whose centre is
  formed by Trent and Franzensfeste; while all the military roads leading
  into Carinthia have been provided with strong defensive works, as at
  Malborgeth, Predil Pass, &amp;c. The two capitals, Vienna and Budapest,
  are not fortified. On the Adriatic coast, the naval harbour of Pola is
  strongly fortified with sea and land defences; then come Trieste, and
  several places in Dalmatia, notably Zara and Cattaro.</p>

  <p><i>Navy.</i>&mdash;The Austro-Hungarian navy is mainly a coast defence
  force, and includes also a flotilla of monitors for the Danube. It is
  administered by the naval department of the ministry of war. It consisted
  in 1905 of 9 modern battleships, 3 armoured cruisers, 5 cruisers, 4
  torpedo gunboats, 20 destroyers and 26 torpedo boats. There was in hand
  at the same time a naval programme to build 12 armourclads, 5
  second-class cruisers, 6 third-class cruisers, and a number of torpedo
  boats. The headquarters of the fleet are at Pola, which is the principal
  naval arsenal and harbour of Austria; while another great naval station
  is Trieste.</p>

  <p><i>Trade.</i>&mdash;On the basis of the customs and commercial
  agreement between Austria and Hungary, concluded in 1867 and renewable
  every ten years, the following affairs, in addition to the common affairs
  of the monarchy, are in both states treated according to the same
  principles:&mdash;Commercial affairs, including customs legislation;
  legislation on the duties closely connected with industrial
  production&mdash;on beer, brandy, sugar and mineral oils; determination
  of legal tender and coinage, as also of the principles regulating the
  Austro-Hungarian Bank; ordinances in respect of such railways as affect
  the interests of both states. In conformity with the customs and
  commercial compact between the two states, renewed in 1899, the monarchy
  constitutes one identical customs and commercial territory, inclusive of
  Bosnia and Herzegovina and the principality of Liechtenstein.</p>

  <p>The most important place of derivation and of destination for the
  Austro-Hungarian trade is the German empire with about 40% of the
  imports, and about 60% of the exports. Next in importance comes Great
  Britain, afterwards India, Italy, the United States of America, Russia,
  France, Switzerland, Rumania, the Balkan states and South America in
  about the order named. The principal articles of import are cotton and
  cotton goods, wool and woollen goods, silk and silk goods, coffee,
  tobacco and metals. The principal articles of export are wood, sugar,
  cattle, glass and glassware, iron and ironware, eggs, cereals, millinery,
  fancy goods, earthenware and pottery, and leather goods.</p>

  <p><i>The Austro-Hungarian Bank.</i>&mdash;Common to the two states of
  the monarchy is the "Austro-Hungarian Bank," which possesses a legal
  exclusive right to the issue of bank-notes. It was founded in 1816, and
  had the title of the Austrian National Bank until 1878, when it received
  its actual name. In virtue of the new bank statute of the year 1899 the
  bank is a joint-stock company, with a stock of £8,780,000. The bank's
  notes of issue must be covered to the extent of two-fifths by legal
  specie (gold and current silver) in reserve; the rest of the paper
  circulation, according to bank usage. The state, under certain
  conditions, takes a portion of the clear profits of the bank. The
  management of the bank and the supervision exercised over it by the state
  are established on a footing of equality, both states having each the
  same influence. The accounts of the bank at the end of 1900 were as
  follows: capital, £8,750,000; reserve fund, £428,250; note circulation,
  £62,251,000; cash, £50,754,000. In 1907 the reserve fund was £548,041;
  note circulation, £84,501,000; cash, £60,036,625. The charter of the
  bank, which expired in 1897, was renewed until the end of 1910. In the
  Hungarian ministerial crisis of 1909 the question of the renewal of the
  charter played a conspicuous part, the more extreme members of the
  Independence party demanding the establishment of separate banks for
  Austria and Hungary with, at most, common superintendence (see
  <i>History</i>, below).</p>

  <p>The empire of Austria, as the official designation of the <span
  class="sidenote">The title "Emperor of Austria."</span> territories ruled
  by the Habsburg monarchy, dates back only to 1804, when Francis II., the
  last of the Holy Roman emperors, proclaimed himself emperor of Austria as
  Francis I. His motive in doing so was to guard against the great house of
  Habsburg being relegated to a position inferior to the <i>parvenus</i>
  Bonapartes, in the event of the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire,
  or of the possible election of Napoleon as his own successor on the
  throne of Charlemagne. The title emperor of Austria, then, replaced that
  of "Imperator Romanorum semper Augustus" when the Holy Empire came to an
  end in 1806. From the first, however, it was no more than a title, which
  represented but ill the actual relation of the Habsburg sovereigns to
  their several states. <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>[v.03 p.0005]</span>Magyars and Slavs never willingly
  recognized a style which ignored their national rights and implied the
  superiority of the German elements of the monarchy; to the Germans it was
  a poor substitute for a title which had represented the political unity
  of the German race under the Holy Empire. For long after the Vienna
  Congress of 1814-1815 the "Kaiser" as such exercised a powerful influence
  over the imaginations of the German people outside the Habsburg
  dominions; but this was because the title was still surrounded with its
  ancient halo and the essential change was not at once recognized. The
  outcome of the long struggle with Prussia, which in 1866 finally broke
  the spell, and the proclamation of the German empire in 1871 left the
  title of emperor of Austria stripped of everything but a purely
  territorial significance. It had, moreover, by the compact with Hungary
  of 1867, ceased even fully to represent the relation of the emperor to
  all his dominions; and the title which had been devised to cover the
  whole of the Habsburg monarchy sank into the official style of the
  sovereign of but a half; while even within the Austrian empire proper it
  is resented by those peoples which, like the Bohemians, wish to obtain
  the same recognition of their national independence as was conceded to
  Hungary. In placing the account of the origin and development of the
  Habsburg monarchy under this heading, it is merely for the sake of
  convenience.</p>

  <p>The first nucleus round which the present dominions of the <span
  class="sidenote">Origin of the name Austria.</span> house of Austria
  gradually accumulated was the mark which lay along the south bank of the
  Danube, east of the river Enns, founded about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 800 as a defence for the Frankish kingdom
  against the Slavs. Although its total length from east to west was only
  about 60 m., it was associated in the popular mind with a large and
  almost unbroken tract of land in the east of Europe. This fact, together
  with the position of the mark with regard to Germany in general and to
  Bavaria in particular, accounts for the name <i>Österreich</i> (Austria),
  <i>i.e.</i> east empire or realm, a word first used in a charter of 996,
  where the phrase <i>in regione vulgari nomine Ostarrichi</i> occurs. The
  development of this small mark into the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was a
  slow and gradual process, and falls into two main divisions, which almost
  coincide with the periods during which the dynasties of Babenberg and
  Habsburg have respectively ruled the land. The energies of the house of
  Babenberg were chiefly spent in enlarging the area and strengthening the
  position of the mark itself, and when this was done the house of Habsburg
  set itself with remarkable perseverance and marvellous success to extend
  its rule over neighbouring territories. The many vicissitudes which have
  attended this development have not, however, altered the European
  position of Austria, which has remained the same for over a thousand
  years. Standing sentinel over the valley of the middle Danube, and
  barring the advance of the Slavs on Germany, Austria, whether mark, duchy
  or empire, has always been the meeting-place of the Teuton and the Slav.
  It is this fact which gives it a unique interest and importance in the
  history of Europe, and which unites the ideas of the Germans to-day with
  those of Charlemagne and Otto the Great.</p>

  <p>The southern part of the country now called Austria was <span
  class="sidenote">Early inhabitants.</span> inhabited before the opening
  of the Christian era by the Taurisci, a Celtic tribe, who were
  subsequently called the Norici, and who were conquered by the Romans
  about 14 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Their land was afterwards
  included in the provinces of Pannonia and Noricum, and under Roman rule,
  Vindobona, the modern Vienna, became a place of some importance. The part
  of the country north of the Danube was peopled by the Marcomanni and the
  Quadi, and both of these tribes were frequently at war with the Romans,
  especially during the reign of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who died at
  Vindobona in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 180 when campaigning against
  them. Christianity and civilization obtained entrance into the land, but
  the increasing weakness of the Roman empire opened the country to the
  inroads of the barbarians, and during the period of the great migrations
  it was ravaged in quick succession by a number of these tribes, prominent
  among whom were the Huns. The lands on both banks of the river shared the
  same fate, due probably to the fact to which Gibbon has drawn attention,
  that at this period the Danube was frequently frozen over. About 590 the
  district was settled by the Slovenes, or Corutanes, a Slavonic people,
  who formed part of the kingdom of Samo, and were afterwards included in
  the extensive kingdom of the Avars. The Franks claimed some authority
  over this people, and probably some of the princes of the Slovenes had
  recognized this claim, but it could not be regarded as serious while the
  Avars were in possession of the land. In 791 Charlemagne, after he had
  established his authority over the <i>Bajuvarii</i> or Bavarians, crossed
  the river Enns, and moved against the Avars. This attack was followed by
  campaigns on the part of his lieutenants, and in 805 the Avars were
  finally subdued, and their land incorporated with the Frankish empire.
  <span class="sidenote">Establishment of the East Mark.</span> This step
  brought the later Austria definitely under the rule of the Franks, and
  during the struggle Charlemagne erected a mark, called the East Mark, to
  defend the eastern border of his empire. A series of margraves ruled this
  small district from 799 to 907, but as the Frankish empire grew weaker,
  the mark suffered more and more from the ravages of its eastern
  neighbours. During the 9th century the Frankish supremacy vanished, and
  the mark was overrun by the Moravians, and then by the Magyars, or
  Hungarians, who destroyed the few remaining traces of Frankish
  influence.</p>

  <p>A new era dawned after Otto the Great was elected German <span
  class="sidenote">The house of Babenberg.</span> king in 936, and it is
  Otto rather than Charlemagne who must be regarded as the real founder of
  Austria. In August 955 he gained a great victory over the Magyars on the
  Lechfeld, freed Bavaria from their presence, and refounded the East Mark
  for the defence of his kingdom. In 976 his son, the emperor Otto II.,
  entrusted the government of this mark, soon to be known as Austria, to
  Leopold, a member of the family of Babenberg (<i>q.v.</i>), and its
  administration was conducted with vigour and success. Leopold and his
  descendants ruled Austria until the extinction of the family in 1246, and
  by their skill and foresight raised the mark to an important place among
  the German states. Their first care was to push its eastern frontier down
  the Danube valley, by colonizing the lands on either side of the river,
  and the success of this work may be seen in the removal of their capital
  from Pöchlarn to Melk, then to Tulln, and finally about 1140 to Vienna.
  The country as far as the Leitha was subsequently incorporated with
  Austria, and in the other direction the district between the Enns and the
  Inn was added to the mark in 1156, an important date in Austrian history.
  <span class="sidenote">Duchy of Austria created, 1156.</span> Anxious to
  restore peace to Germany in this year, the new king, Frederick I., raised
  Austria to the rank of a duchy, and conferred upon it exceptional
  privileges. The investiture was bestowed not only upon Duke Henry but
  upon his second wife, Theodora; in case of a failure of male heirs the
  duchy was to descend to females; and if the duke had no children he could
  nominate his successor. Controlling all the jurisdiction of the land, the
  duke's only duties towards the Empire were to appear at any diet held in
  Bavaria, and to send a contingent to the imperial army for any campaigns
  in the countries bordering upon Austria. In 1186 Duke Leopold I. made a
  treaty with Ottakar IV., duke of Styria, an arrangement which brought
  Styria and upper Austria to the Babenbergs in 1192, and in 1229 Duke
  Leopold II. purchased some lands from the bishop of Freising, and took
  the title of lord of Carniola. When the house of Babenberg became extinct
  in 1246, Austria, stretching from Passau almost to Pressburg, had the
  frontiers which it retains to-day, and this increase of territory had
  been accompanied by a corresponding increase in wealth and general
  prosperity. The chief reason for this prosperity was the growth of trade
  along the Danube, which stimulated the foundation, or the growth, of
  towns, and brought considerable riches to the ruler. Under the later
  Babenbergs Vienna was regarded as one of the most important of German
  cities, and it was computed that the duke was as rich as the archbishop
  of Cologne, or the margrave of Brandenburg, and was surpassed in this
  respect by only one German prince, the <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[v.03 p.0006]</span>king of Bohemia.
  The interests of the Austrian margraves and dukes were not confined to
  the acquisition of wealth either in land or chattels. Vienna became a
  centre of culture and learning, and many religious houses were founded
  and endowed. <span class="sidenote">Duke Leopold II.</span> The acme of
  the early prosperity of Austria was reached under Duke Leopold II.,
  surnamed the Glorious, who reigned from 1194 to 1230. He gave a code of
  municipal law to Vienna, and rights to other towns, welcomed the
  Minnesingers to his brilliant court, and left to his subjects an enduring
  memory of valour and wisdom. Leopold and his predecessors were enabled,
  owing to the special position of Austria, to act practically as
  independent rulers. Cherishing the privilege of 1156, they made treaties
  with foreign kings, and arranged marriages with the great families of
  Europe. With full control of jurisdiction and of commerce, no great
  bishopric nor imperial city impeded the course of their authority, and
  the emperor interfered only to settle boundary disputes.</p>

  <p>The main lines of Austrian policy under the Babenbergs were warfare
  with the Hungarians and other eastern neighbours, and a general attitude
  of loyalty towards the emperors. The story of the Hungarian wars is a
  monotonous record of forays, of assistance given at times to the
  Babenbergs by the forces of the Empire, and ending in the gradual
  eastward advance of Austria. <span class="sidenote">Duke Frederick II.,
  the Quarrelsome.</span> The traditional loyalty to the emperors, which
  was cemented by several marriages between the imperial house and the
  Babenbergs, was, however, departed from by the margrave Leopold II., and
  by Duke Frederick II. During the investiture struggle Leopold deserted
  the emperor Henry IV., who deprived him of Austria and conferred it upon
  Vratislav II., duke of the Bohemians. Unable to maintain his position,
  Vratislav was soon driven out, and in 1083 Leopold again obtained
  possession of the mark, and was soon reconciled with Henry. Very similar
  was the result of the conflict between the emperor Frederick II. and Duke
  Frederick II. Ignoring the the privilege of 1156, the emperor claimed
  certain rights in Austria, and summoned the duke to his Italian diets.
  Frederick, who was called the Quarrelsome, had irritated both his
  neighbours and his subjects, and complaints of his exactions and
  confiscations reached the ears of the emperor. After the duke had three
  times refused to appear before the princes, Frederick placed him under
  the ban, declared the duchies of Austria and Styria to be vacant, and,
  aided by the king of Bohemia, the duke of Bavaria and other princes,
  invaded the country in 1236. <span class="sidenote">End of the House of
  Babenberg.</span> He met with very slight opposition, declared the
  duchies to be immediately dependent upon the Empire, made Vienna an
  imperial city, and imposed other changes upon the constitution of
  Austria. After his departure, however, the duke returned, and in 1239 was
  in possession of his former power, while the changes made by the emperor
  were ignored. Continuing his career of violence and oppression, Duke
  Frederick was killed in battle by the Hungarians in June 1246, when the
  family of Babenberg became extinct.</p>

  <p>The duchies of Austria and Styria were now claimed by the <span
  class="sidenote">Dispute as to the Austrian succession.</span> emperor
  Frederick II. as vacant fiefs of the Empire, and their government was
  entrusted to Otto II., duke of Bavaria. Frederick, however, who was in
  Italy, harassed and afflicted, could do little to assert the imperial
  authority, and his enemy, Pope Innocent IV., bestowed the two duchies
  upon Hermann VI., margrave of Baden, whose wife, Gertrude, was a niece of
  the last of the Babenbergs. Hermann was invested by the German king,
  William, count of Holland, but he was unable to establish his position,
  and law and order were quickly disappearing from the duchies. The deaths
  of Hermann and of the emperor in 1250, however, paved the way for a
  settlement. Weary of struggle and disorder, and despairing of any help
  from the central authority, the estates of Austria met at Trübensee in
  1251, and chose Ottakar, son of Wenceslaus I., king of Bohemia, as their
  duke. <span class="sidenote">Ottakar of Bohemia, duke.</span> This step
  was favoured by the pope, and Ottakar, eagerly accepting the offer,
  strengthened his position by marrying Margaret, a sister of Duke
  Frederick II., and in return for his investiture promised his assistance
  to William of Holland. Styria appears at this time to have shared the
  fortunes of Austria, but it was claimed by Bela IV., king of Hungary, who
  conquered the land, and made a treaty with Ottakar in 1254 which
  confirmed him in its possession. The Hungarian rule was soon resented by
  the Styrians, and Ottakar, who had become king of Bohemia in 1253, took
  advantage of this resentment, and interfered in the affairs of the duchy.
  A war with Hungary was the result, but on this occasion victory rested
  with Ottakar, and by a treaty made with Bela, in March 1261, he was
  recognized as duke of Styria. In 1269 Ottakar inherited the duchy of
  Carinthia on the death of Duke Ulrich III., and, his power having now
  become very great, he began to aspire to the German throne. He did
  something to improve the condition of the duchies by restoring order,
  introducing German colonists into the eastern districts, and seeking to
  benefit the inhabitants of the towns.</p>

  <p>In 1273 Rudolph, count of Habsburg, became German king, <span
  class="sidenote">Rudolph of Habsburg.</span> and his attention soon
  turned to Ottakar, whose power menaced the occupant of the German throne.
  Finding some support in Austria, Rudolph questioned the title of the
  Bohemian king to the three duchies, and sought to recover the imperial
  lands which had been in the possession of the emperor Frederick II.
  Ottakar was summoned twice before the diet, the imperial court declared
  against him, and in July 1275 he was placed under the ban. War was the
  result, and in November 1276 Ottakar submitted to Rudolph, and renounced
  the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia. For some time the three
  duchies were administered by Rudolph in his capacity as head of the
  Empire, of which they formed part. Not content with this tie, however,
  which was personal to himself alone, the king planned to make them
  hereditary possessions of his family, and to transfer the headquarters of
  the Habsburgs from the Rhine to the Danube. <span class="sidenote">The
  Habsburgs established in Austria, 1282.</span> Some opposition was
  offered to this scheme; but the perseverance of the king overcame all
  difficulties, and one of the most important events in European history
  took place on the 27th of December 1282, when Rudolph invested his sons,
  Rudolph and Albert, with the duchies of Austria and Styria. He retained
  Carinthia in his own hands until 1286, when, in return for valuable
  services, he bestowed it upon Meinhard IV., count of Tirol. The younger
  Rudolph took no part in the government of Austria and Styria, which was
  undertaken by Albert, until his election as German king in 1298. Albert
  appears to have been rather an arbitrary ruler. In 1288 he suppressed a
  rising of the people of Vienna, and he made the fullest use of the ducal
  power in asserting his real or supposed rights. At this time the
  principle of primogeniture was unknown in the house of Habsburg, and for
  many years the duchies were ruled in common by two, or even three,
  members of the family. After Albert became German king, his two elder
  sons, Rudolph and Frederick, were successively associated with him in the
  government, and after his death in 1308, his four younger sons shared at
  one time or another in the administration of Austria and Styria. In 1314
  Albert's son, Frederick, was chosen German king in opposition to Louis
  IV., duke of Upper Bavaria, afterwards the emperor Louis IV., and Austria
  was weakened by the efforts of the Habsburgs to sustain Frederick in his
  contest with Louis, and also by the struggle carried on between another
  brother, Leopold, and the Swiss. A series of deaths among the Habsburgs
  during the first half of the 14th century left Duke Albert II. and his
  four sons as the only representatives of the family. Albert ruled the
  duchies alone from 1344 to 1356, and after this date his sons began to
  take part in the government. <span class="sidenote">Duke Rudolph
  IV.</span> The most noteworthy of these was Duke Rudolph IV., a
  son-in-law of the emperor Charles IV., who showed his interest in
  learning by founding the university of Vienna in 1365. Rudolph's chief
  aim was to make Austria into an independent state, and he forged a series
  of privileges the purport of which was to free the duchy from all its
  duties towards the Empire. A sharp contest with the emperor followed this
  proceeding, and the Austrian duke, annoyed that <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[v.03 p.0007]</span>Austria was not
  raised to the dignity of an electorate by the Golden Bull of 1356, did
  not shrink from a contest with Charles. In 1361, however, he abandoned
  his pretensions, but claimed the title of archduke (<i>q.v.</i>) and in
  1364 declared that the possessions of the Habsburgs were indivisible.
  Meanwhile the acquisition of neighbouring territories had been steadily
  pressed on. In 1335 the duchy of Carinthia, and a part of Carniola, were
  inherited by Dukes Albert II. and Otto, and in 1363 Rudolph IV. obtained
  the county of Tirol. In 1364 Carniola was made into an hereditary duchy;
  in 1374 part of Istria came under the rule of the Habsburgs; in 1382
  Trieste submitted voluntarily to Austria, and at various times during the
  century, other smaller districts were added to the lands of the
  Habsburgs.</p>

  <p>Rudolph IV. died childless in 1365, and in 1379 his two remaining
  brothers, Leopold III. and Albert III., made a division of their lands,
  by which Albert retained Austria proper and Carniola, and Leopold got
  Styria, Carinthia and Tirol. Leopold was killed in 1386 at the battle of
  Sempach, and Albert became guardian for his four nephews, who
  subsequently ruled their lands in common. The senior line which ruled in
  Austria was represented after the death of Duke Albert III. in 1395 by
  his son, Duke Albert IV., and then by his grandson, Duke Albert V., who
  became German king as Albert II. in 1438. <span class="sidenote">Minority
  of Ladislaus.</span> Albert married Elizabeth, daughter of Sigismund,
  king of Hungary and Bohemia, and on the death of his father-in-law
  assumed these two crowns. He died in 1439, and just after his death a son
  was born to him, who was called Ladislaus Posthumus, and succeeded to the
  duchy of Austria and to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia. William and
  Leopold, the two eldest sons of Duke Leopold III., and, with their
  younger brothers Ernest and Frederick, the joint rulers of Styria,
  Carinthia and Tirol, died early in the 15th century, and in 1406 Ernest
  and Frederick made a division of their lands. Ernest became duke of
  Styria and Carinthia, and Frederick, count of Tirol. Ernest was succeeded
  in 1424 by his sons, Frederick and Albert, and Frederick in 1439 by his
  son, Sigismund, and these three princes were reigning when King Albert
  II. died in 1439. Frederick, who succeeded Albert <span
  class="sidenote">Regency of the emperor Frederick III.</span> as German
  king, and was soon crowned emperor as Frederick III., acted as guardian
  for Sigismund of Tirol, who was a minor, and also became regent of
  Austria in consequence of the infancy of Ladislaus. His rule was a period
  of struggle and disorder, owing partly to the feebleness of his own
  character, partly to the wish of his brother, Albert, to share his
  dignities. The Tirolese soon grew weary of his government, and, in 1446,
  Sigismund was declared of age. <span class="sidenote">Popular revolt
  under Ulrich Eiczing and Count Ulrich of Cilli.</span> The estates of
  Austria were equally discontented and headed an open revolt, the object
  of which was to remove Ladislaus from Frederick's charge and deprive the
  latter of the regency. The leading spirit in this movement was Ulrich
  Eiczing (Eitzing or von Eiczinger, d. before 1463), a low-born
  adventurer, ennobled by Albert II., in whose service he had accumulated
  vast wealth and power. In 1451 he organized an armed league, and in
  December, with the aid of the populace, made himself master of Vienna,
  whither he had summoned the estates. In March 1452 he was joined by Count
  Ulrich of Cilli, while the Hungarians and the powerful party of the great
  house of Rosenberg in Bohemia attached themselves to the league.
  Frederick, who had hurried back from Italy, was besieged in August in the
  Vienna Neustadt, and was forced to deliver Ladislaus to Count Ulrich,
  whose influence had meanwhile eclipsed that of Eiczing. Ladislaus now
  ruled nominally himself, under the tutelage of Count Ulrich. The country
  was, however, distracted by quarrels between the party of the high
  aristocracy, which recognized the count of Cilli as its chief, and that
  of the lesser nobles, citizens and populace, who followed Eiczing. In
  September 1453 the latter, by a successful <i>émeute</i>, succeeded in
  ousting Count Ulrich, and remained in power till February 1455, when the
  count once more entered Vienna in triumph. Ulrich of Cilli was killed
  before Belgrade in November 1456; a year later Ladislaus himself died
  (November 1457). Meanwhile Styria and Carinthia <span
  class="sidenote">Austria created an archduchy.</span> were equally
  unfortunate under the rule of Frederick and Albert; and the death of
  Ladislaus led to still further complications. Austria, which had been
  solemnly created an archduchy by the emperor Frederick in 1453, was
  claimed by the three remaining Habsburg princes, and lower Austria was
  secured by Frederick, while Albert obtained upper Austria. Both princes
  were unpopular, and in 1462 Frederick was attacked by the inhabitants of
  Vienna, and was forced to surrender lower Austria to Albert, whose
  spendthrift habits soon made his rule disliked. A further struggle
  between the brothers was prevented by Albert's death in 1463, when the
  estates did homage to Frederick. <span class="sidenote">Hungarian
  conquest of Austria.</span> The emperor was soon again at issue with the
  Austrian nobles, and was attacked by Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary,
  who drove him from Vienna in 1485. Although hampered by the inroads of
  the Turks, Matthias pressed on, and by 1487 was firmly in possession of
  Austria, Styria and Carinthia, which seemed quite lost to the
  Habsburgs.</p>

  <p>The decline in the fortunes of the family, however, was <span
  class="sidenote">The emperor Maximilian I.</span> to be arrested by
  Frederick's son, Maximilian, afterwards the emperor Maximilian I., who
  was the second founder of the greatness of the house of Habsburg. Like
  his ancestor, Rudolph, he had to conquer the lands over which his
  descendants were destined to rule, and by arranging a treaty of
  succession to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia, he pointed the way to
  power and empire in eastern Europe. Soon after his election as king of
  the Romans in 1486, Maximilian attacked the Hungarians, and in 1490 he
  had driven them from Austria, and recovered his hereditary lands. In the
  same year he made an arrangement with his kinsman, Sigismund of Tirol, by
  which he brought this county under his rule, and when the emperor
  Frederick died in 1493, Maximilian united the whole of the Austrian lands
  under his sway. Continuing his acquisitions of territory, he inherited
  the possessions of the counts of Görz in 1500, added some districts to
  Tirol by intervening in a succession war in Bavaria, and acquired
  Gradisca in 1512 as the result of a struggle with Venice. He did much for
  the better government of the Austrian duchies. Bodies were established
  for executive, financial and judicial purposes, the Austrian lands
  constituted one of the imperial circles which were established in 1512,
  and in 1518 representatives of the various diets (<i>Landtage</i>) met at
  Innsbruck, a proceeding which marks the beginning of an organic unity in
  the Austrian lands. In these ways Maximilian proved himself a capable and
  energetic ruler, although his plans for making Austria into a kingdom, or
  an electorate, were abortive.</p>

  <p>At the close of the middle ages the area of Austria had increased
  <span class="sidenote">Austria at the close of the middle ages.</span> to
  nearly 50,000 sq. m., but its internal condition does not appear to have
  improved in proportion to this increase in size. The rulers of Austria
  lacked the prestige which attached to the electoral office, and, although
  five of them had held the position of German king, the four who preceded
  Maximilian had added little or nothing to the power and dignity of this
  position. The ecclesiastical organization of Austria was imperfect, so
  long as there was no archbishopric within its borders, and its clergy
  owed allegiance to foreign prelates. The work of unification which was so
  successfully accomplished by Maximilian was aided by two events, the
  progress of the Turks in south-eastern Europe, and the loss of most of
  the Habsburg possessions on the Rhine. The first tended to draw the
  separate states together for purposes of defence, and the second turned
  the attention of the Habsburgs to the possibilities of expansion in
  eastern Europe.</p>

  <p>(A. W. H.*)</p>

  <p>At the time of the death of the emperor Maximilian in 1519 <span
  class="sidenote">Austria under Charles V. and Ferdinand.</span> the
  Habsburg dominions in eastern Germany included the duchies of Upper and
  Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and the county of Tirol.
  Maximilian was succeeded as archduke of Austria as well as emperor by his
  grandson Charles of Spain, known in history as the emperor Charles V. To
  his brother Ferdinand Charles resigned all his Austrian lands, including
  his claims on Bohemia <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>[v.03 p.0008]</span>and Hungary. <span
  class="sidenote">Mohács and its results.</span> Austria and Spain were
  thus divided, and, in spite of the efforts of the archduke Charles in the
  Spanish Succession War, were never again united, for at the battle of
  Mohács, on the 28th of August 1526, Suleiman the Magnificent defeated and
  killed Louis, king of Bohemia and of Hungary, whose sister Anne had
  married Ferdinand. By this victory the Turks conquered and retained, till
  the peace of Karlowitz in 1699, the greater part of Hungary. During most
  of his life Ferdinand was engaged in combating the Turks and in
  attempting to secure Hungary. In John Zápolya, who was supported by
  Suleiman, Ferdinand found an active rival. The Turks besieged Vienna in
  1530 and made several invasions of Hungary and Austria. At length
  Ferdinand agreed to pay Suleiman an annual tribute for the small
  portion&mdash;about 12,228 sq. m.&mdash;of Hungary which he held. <span
  class="sidenote">Charles V. and Austria.</span> During Charles V.'s
  struggles with the German Protestants, Ferdinand preserved a neutral
  attitude, which contributed to gain Germany a short period of internal
  peace. Though Ferdinand himself did not take a leading part in German
  religious or foreign politics, the period was one of intense interest to
  Austria. Throughout the years from 1519 to 1648 there are, said Stubbs,
  two distinct ideas in progress which "may be regarded as giving a unity
  to the whole period.... The Reformation is one, the claims of the House
  of Austria is the other." Austria did not benefit from the reign of
  Charles V. The emperor was too much absorbed in the affairs of the rest
  of his vast dominions, notably those of the Empire, rent in two by
  religious differences and the secular ambitions for which those were the
  excuse, to give any effective attention to its needs. The peace of
  Augsburg, 1555, which recognized a dualism within the Empire in religion
  as in politics, marked the failure of his plan of union (see <span
  class="sc">Charles V.</span>; <span class="sc">Germany</span>; <span
  class="sc">Maurice of Saxony</span>); and meanwhile he had been able to
  accomplish nothing to rescue Hungary from the Turkish yoke. It was left
  for his brother Ferdinand, a ruler of consummate wisdom (1556-1564) "to
  establish the modern Habsburg-Austrian empire with its exclusive
  territorial interests, its administrative experiments, its intricacies of
  religion and of race."</p>

  <p>Before his death Ferdinand divided the inheritance of the <span
  class="sidenote">The policy of Ferdinand and Maximillian II.</span>
  German Habsburgs between his three sons. Austria proper was left to his
  eldest son Maximilian, Tirol to the archduke Ferdinand; and Styria with
  Carinthia and Carniola to the archduke Charles. Under the emperor
  Maximilian II. (1564-1576), who was also king of Bohemia and Hungary, a
  liberal policy preserved peace, but he was unable to free his government
  from its humiliating position of a tributary to the Turk, and he could do
  nothing to found religious liberty within his dominions on a permanent
  basis. The whole of Austria and nearly the whole of Styria were mainly
  Lutheran; in Bohemia, Silesia and Moravia, various forms of Christian
  belief struggled for mastery; and Catholicism was almost confined to the
  mountains of Tirol. <span class="sidenote">The reign of Rudolph
  II.</span> The accession of Rudolph II.<a name="FnAnchor_021"
  href="#Footnote_021"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (1576-1612), a fanatical Spanish
  Catholic, changed the situation entirely. Under him the Jesuits were
  encouraged to press on the counter-Reformation. In the early part of his
  reign there was hardly any government at all. In Bohemia a state of
  semi-independence existed, while Hungary preferred <span
  class="sidenote">The family compact, 1606.</span> the Turk to the
  emperor. In both kingdoms Rudolph had failed to assert his sovereign
  power except in fitful attempts to extirpate heresy. With anarchy
  prevalent within the Austrian dominions some action became necessary.
  Accordingly in 1606 the archdukes made a compact agreeing to acknowledge
  the archduke Matthias as head of the family. This arrangement proved far
  from successful. Matthias, who was emperor from 1612 to 1619, proved
  unable to restore order, and when he died Bohemia was practically
  independent. His successor Ferdinand II. (1619-1637) was strong of will;
  and resolved to win back Germany to the Catholic faith. As archduke of
  Styria he had crushed out Protestantism <span class="sidenote">The Thirty
  Years' War.</span> in that duchy, and having been elected king of Bohemia
  in 1618 was resolved to establish there the rule of the Jesuits. His
  attempt to do so led to the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War (see <span
  class="sc">Bohemia</span>; <span class="sc">Thirty Years' War</span>).
  Till 1630 the fortunes of Austria brightened under the active rule of
  Ferdinand, who was assisted by Maximilian of Bavaria and the Catholic
  League, and by Wallenstein. The Palatinate was conquered, the Danish king
  was overthrown, and it seemed that Austria would establish its
  predominance over the whole of Germany, and that the Baltic would become
  an Austrian lake. The fortunes of Austria never seemed brighter than in
  1628 when Wallenstein began the siege of Stralsund. <span
  class="sidenote">The Swedish and French intervention.</span> His failure,
  followed by the arrival of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany in 1630, proved
  the death blow of Austrian hopes. In 1632 Gustavus Adolphus was killed,
  in 1634 Wallenstein was assassinated, and in 1635 France entered into the
  war. The Thirty Years' War now ceased to be a religious struggle between
  Catholicism and Protestantism; it resolved itself into a return to the
  old political strife between France and the Habsburgs. <span
  class="sidenote">The peace of Westphalia, 1648.</span> Till 1648 the
  Bourbon and Habsburg powers continued the war, and at the peace of
  Westphalia Austria suffered severe losses. Ferdinand III. (1637-1657) was
  forced to yield Alsace to France, to grant territorial supremacy,
  including the right of making alliances, to the states of the Empire, and
  to acknowledge the concurrent jurisdiction of the imperial chamber and
  the Aulic council. The disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire was now
  practically accomplished, and though the possession of the imperial
  dignity continued to give the rulers of Austria prestige, the Habsburgs
  henceforward devoted themselves to their Austrian interests rather than
  to those of the Empire.</p>

  <p>In 1657 Leopold I., who had already ruled the Austrian <span
  class="sidenote">Leopold I.</span> dominions for two years, succeeded his
  father Ferdinand and was crowned emperor in the following year. His long
  reign of 48 years was of great importance for Austria, as determining
  both the internal character and the external policy of the monarchy. The
  long struggle with France to which the ambitions of Louis XIV. gave rise,
  and which culminated in the War of Spanish Succession, belongs less to
  the history of Austria proper than to that of Germany and of Europe.
  <span class="sidenote">Wars with Turkey.</span> Of more importance to
  Austria itself was the war with Sweden (1657-60) which resulted in the
  peace of Oliva, by which the independence of Poland was secured and the
  frontier of Hungary safeguarded, and the campaigns against the Turks
  (1662-64 and 1683-99), by which the Ottoman power was driven from
  Hungary, and the Austrian attitude towards Turkey and the Slav peoples of
  the Balkans determined for a century to come. The first war, due to
  Ottoman aggression in Transylvania, ended with Montecuculi's victory over
  the grand vizier at St Gothard on the Raab on the 1st of August 1664. The
  general political situation prevented Leopold from taking full advantage
  of this, and the peace of Vasvár (August 10) left the Turks in possession
  of Nagyvarad (Grosswardein) and the fortress of Érsekujvár (Neuhäusel),
  Transylvania being recognized as an independent principality. The next
  Turkish war was the direct outcome of Leopold's policy in Hungary, where
  the persecution of the Protestants and the suppression of the
  constitution in 1658, led to a widespread conspiracy. This was
  mercilessly suppressed; and though after a period of arbitrary government
  (1672-1679), the palatinate and the constitution, with certain
  concessions to the Protestants, were restored, the discontent continued.
  In 1683, invited by Hungarian malcontents and spurred on by Louis XIV.,
  the Turks burst into Hungary, overran the country and appeared before the
  walls of Vienna. The victory of the 12th of September, gained over the
  Turks by John Sobieski (see <span class="sc">John III. Sobieski, King of
  Poland</span>) not only saved the Austrian capital, but was the first of
  a series of successes which drove the Turks permanently beyond the
  Danube, and established the power of Austria in the East. The victories
  of Charles of Lorraine at Párkány (1683) and Esztergom (Gran) (1685) were
  followed by the capture of Budapest (1686) and the defeat of the Ottomans
  at <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[v.03
  p.0009]</span>Mohács (1688). In 1688 the elector took Belgrade; in 1691
  Louis William I. of Baden won the battle of Slankamen, and on the 11th of
  September 1697 Prince Eugene gained the crowning victory of Zenta. This
  was followed, on the 26th of January 1699, by the peace of Karlowitz, by
  which Slavonia, Transylvania and all Hungary, except the banat of
  Temesvár, were ceded to the Austrian crown. Leopold had wisely decided to
  initiate a conciliatory policy in Hungary. At the diet of Pressburg
  (1687-1688) the Hungarian crown had been made hereditary in the house of
  Habsburg, and the crown prince Joseph had been crowned hereditary king of
  Hungary (<i>q.v.</i>). In 1697 Transylvania was united to the Hungarian
  monarchy. A further fact of great prospective importance was the
  immigration, after an abortive rising against the Turks, of some 30,000
  Slav and Albanian families into Slavonia and southern Hungary, where they
  were granted by the emperor Leopold a certain autonomy and the
  recognition of the Orthodox religion.</p>

  <p>By the conquest of Hungary and Transylvania Leopold completed the
  edifice of the Austrian monarchy, of which the foundations had been laid
  by Ferdinand I. in 1526. He had also done much for its internal
  consolidation. By the death of the archduke Sigismund in 1665 he not only
  gained Tirol, but a considerable sum of money, which he used to buy back
  the Silesian principalities of Oppeln and Ratibor, pledged by Ferdinand
  III. to the Poles. In the administration of his dominions, too, Leopold
  succeeded in strengthening the authority of the central government. The
  old estates, indeed, survived; but the emperor kept the effective power
  in his own hands, and to his reign are traceable the first beginnings of
  that system of centralized bureaucracy which was established under Maria
  Theresa and survived, for better or for worse, till the revolution of
  1848. It was under Leopold, also, that the Austrian standing army was
  established in spite of much opposition; the regiments raised in 1672
  were never disbanded. For the intellectual life of the country Leopold
  did much. In spite of his intolerant attitude towards religious dissent,
  he proved himself an enlightened patron of learning. He helped in the
  establishment of the universities of Innsbruck and Olmütz; and under his
  auspices, after the defeat of the Turks in 1683, Vienna began to develop
  from a mere frontier fortress into one of the most brilliant capitals of
  Europe. (See <span class="sc">Leopold I.</span>)</p>

  <p>Leopold died in 1705 during the war of Spanish Succession <span
  class="sidenote">War of Spanish Succession.</span> (1702-13), which he
  left as an evil inheritance to his sons Joseph I. (d. 1711) and Charles
  VI. The result of the war was a further aggrandizement of the house of
  Austria; but not to the extent that had been hoped. Apart from the fact
  that British and Austrian troops had been unable to deprive Philip V. of
  his throne, it was from the point of view of Europe at large by no means
  desirable that Charles VI. should succeed in reviving the empire of
  Charles V. By the treaty of Utrecht, accordingly, Spain was left to the
  House of Bourbon, while that of Austria received the Spanish Netherlands,
  Sardinia and Naples.</p>

  <p>The treaty of Karlowitz, and the settlement of 1713-1714, <span
  class="sidenote">Austria from 1715 to 1740.</span> marked a new
  starting-point in the history of Austria. The efforts of Turkey to regain
  her ascendancy in eastern Europe at the expense of the Habsburgs had
  ended in failure, and henceforward Turkish efforts were confined to
  resisting the steady development of Austria in the direction of
  Constantinople. The treaties of Utrecht, Rastadt and Baden had also
  re-established and strengthened the position of the Austrian monarchy in
  western Europe. The days of French invasions of Germany had for the time
  ceased, and revenge for the attacks made by Louis XIV. was found in the
  establishment of Austrian supremacy in Italy and in the substitution of
  Austrian for Spanish domination in the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The situation, though apparently favourable, was full of difficulty,
  and only a statesman of uncommon dexterity could have guided Austria with
  success through the ensuing years. Composed of a congeries of
  nationalities which included Czechs, Magyars, Ruthenes, Rumanians,
  Germans, Italians, Flemings and other races, and with territories
  separated by many miles, the Habsburg dominions required from their ruler
  patience, tolerance, administrative skill and a full knowledge of the
  currents of European diplomacy. Charles VI. possessed none of these
  qualities; and when he died in 1740, the weakness of the scattered
  Habsburg empire rendered it an object of the cupidity of the continental
  powers. Yet, though the War of Spanish Succession had proved a heavy
  drain on the resources of the hereditary dominions of the Austrian crown,
  Charles VI. had done much to compensate for this by the successes of his
  arms in eastern Europe. In 1716, in alliance with Venice, he declared war
  on the Turks; Eugene's victory at Peterwardein involved the conquest of
  the banat of Temesvár, and was followed in 1717 by the capture of
  Belgrade. By the treaty signed at Passarowitz on the 21st of July 1718,
  the banat, which rounded off Hungary and Belgrade, with the northern
  districts of Servia, were annexed to the Habsburg monarchy.</p>

  <p>Important as these gains were, the treaty none the less once more
  illustrated the perpetual sacrifice of the true interests of the
  hereditary dominions of the house of Habsburg to its European
  entanglements. Had the war continued, Austria would undoubtedly have
  extended her conquests down the Danube. But Charles was anxious about
  Italy, then in danger from Spain, which under Alberoni's guidance had
  occupied Sardinia and Sicily. On the 2nd of August 1718, accordingly,
  Charles joined the Triple Alliance, henceforth the Quadruple Alliance.
  The coercion of Spain resulted in a peace by which Charles obtained
  Sicily in exchange for Sardinia. The shifting of the balance of power
  that followed belongs to the history of Europe (<i>q.v.</i>); for Austria
  the only important outcome was that in 1731 Charles found himself
  isolated. <span class="sidenote">The Pragmatic Sanction.</span> Being
  without a son, he was now anxious to secure the throne for his daughter
  Maria Theresa, in accordance with the Pragmatic Sanction of the 19th of
  April 1713, in which he had pronounced the indivisibility of the
  monarchy, and had settled the succession on his daughter, in default of a
  male heir. It now became his object to secure the adhesion of the powers
  to this instrument. In 1731 Great Britain and Holland agreed to respect
  it, in return for the cession of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla to Don
  Carlos; but the hostility of the Bourbon powers continued, resulting in
  1733 in the War of Polish Succession, the outcome of which was the
  acquisition of Lorraine by France, and of Naples, Sicily and the Tuscan
  ports by Don Carlos, while the power of the Habsburg monarchy in northern
  Italy was strengthened by the acquisition of Parma, Piacenza and
  Guastalla. At the same time Spain and Sardinia adhered to the Pragmatic
  Sanction. Francis, the dispossessed duke of Lorraine, was to be
  compensated with Tuscany. On the 12th of February 1736 he was married to
  the archduchess Maria Theresa, and on the 11th of May following he signed
  the formal act ceding Lorraine to France.</p>

  <p>The last years of Charles VI. were embittered by the disastrous <span
  class="sidenote">Treaty of Belgrade, 1739.</span> outcome of the war with
  Turkey (1738-1739), on which he had felt compelled to embark in
  accordance with the terms of a treaty of alliance with Russia signed in
  1726. After a campaign of varying fortunes the Turks beat the imperial
  troops at Krotzka on the 23rd of July 1739 and laid siege to Belgrade,
  where on the 1st of September a treaty was signed, which, with the
  exception of the banat, surrendered everything that Austria had gained by
  the treaty of Passarowitz. On the 20th of October 1740, Charles died,
  leaving his dominions in no condition to resist the attacks of the
  powers, which, in spite of having adhered to the Pragmatic Sanction, now
  sought to profit from their weakness. Yet for their internal development
  Charles had done much. His religious attitude was moderate and tolerant,
  and he did his best to promote the enlightenment of his subjects. He was
  zealous, too, for the promotion of trade and industry, and, besides the
  East India Company which he established at Ostend, he encouraged the
  development of Trieste and Fiume as sea-ports and centres of trade with
  the Levant.</p>

<p><!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[v.03 p.0010]</span></p>

  <p>The accession of Maria Theresa to the throne of the Habsburgs <span
  class="sidenote">Maria Theresa.</span> marks an important epoch in the
  history of Austria. For a while, indeed, it seemed that the monarchy was
  on the point of dissolution. To the diplomacy of the 18th century the
  breach of a solemn compact was but lightly regarded; and Charles VI. had
  neglected the advice of Prince Eugene to leave an effective army of
  200,000 men as a more solid guarantee of the Pragmatic Sanction than the
  signatures of the powers. As it was, the Austrian forces, disorganized in
  the long confusion of the Turkish wars, were in no condition to withstand
  Frederick the Great, when in 1740, at the head of the splendid army
  bequeathed to him by his father, he invaded Silesia (see <span
  class="sc">Austrian Succession, War of</span>). The Prussian victory at
  Mollwitz (April 10, 1741) brought into the field against Austria all the
  powers which were ambitious of expansion at her expense: France, Bavaria,
  Spain, Saxony and Sardinia. Nor was the peril wholly external. Apart from
  the perennial discontents of Magyars and Slavs, the confusion and
  corruption of the administration, and the misery caused by the ruin of
  the finances, had made the Habsburg dynasty unpopular even in its German
  states, and in Vienna itself a large section of public opinion was loudly
  in favour of the claims of Charles of Bavaria. Yet the war, if it
  revealed the weakness of the Austrian monarchy, revealed also unexpected
  sources of strength. Not the least of these was the character of Maria
  Theresa herself, who to the fascination of a young and beautiful woman
  added a very masculine resolution and judgment. In response to her
  personal appeal, and also to her wise and timely concessions, the
  Hungarians had rallied to her support, and for the first time in history
  awoke not only to a feeling of enthusiastic loyalty to a Habsburg
  monarch, but also to the realization that their true interests were bound
  up with those of Austria (see <span class="sc">Hungary</span>:
  <i>History</i>). Although, then, as the result of the war, Silesia was by
  the treaty of Dresden transferred from Austria to Prussia, while in Italy
  by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 cessions were made at the
  expense of the house of Habsburg to the Spanish Don Philip and to
  Sardinia, the Austrian monarchy as a whole had displayed a vitality that
  had astonished the world, and was in some respects stronger than at the
  beginning of the struggle, notably in the great improvement in the army
  and in the possession of generals schooled by the experience of active
  service.</p>

  <p>The period from 1747 to 1756, the year of the outbreak of the Seven
  Years' War, was occupied in preparations for carrying into effect the
  determination of Maria Theresa to recover the lost provinces. To give any
  chance of success, it was recognized that a twofold change of system was
  necessary: in internal and in external affairs. To strengthen the state
  internally a complete revolution of its administration was begun under
  the auspices of Count F.&nbsp;W. Haugwitz (1700-1765); the motley system which
  had survived from the middle ages was gradually replaced by an
  administrative machinery uniformly organized and centralized; and the
  army especially, hitherto patched together from the quotas raised and
  maintained by the various diets and provincial estates, was withdrawn
  from their interference. These reforms were practically confined to the
  central provinces of the monarchy; for in Hungary, as well as in the
  outlying territories of Lombardy and the Netherlands, it was recognized
  that the conservative temper of the peoples made any revolutionary change
  in the traditional system inadvisable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in foreign affairs, it had become clear that for <span
  class="sidenote">Austrian-French alliance, and Seven Years' War.</span>
  Austria the enemy to be dreaded was no longer France, but Prussia, and
  Kaunitz prepared the way for a diplomatic revolution, which took effect
  when, on the 1st of May 1756, Austria and France concluded the first
  treaty of Versailles. The long rivalry between Bourbons and Habsburgs was
  thus ended, and France and Austria remained in alliance or at peace until
  the outbreak of the French Revolution. So far as Austria was concerned,
  the Seven Years' War (<i>q.v.</i>) in which France and Austria were
  ranged against Prussia and Great Britain, was an attempt on the part of
  Maria Theresa to recover Silesia. It failed; and the peace of
  Hubertsburg, signed on the 15th of February 1763, left Germany divided
  between Austria and Prussia, whose rivalry for the hegemony was to last
  until the victory of Königgrätz (1866) definitely decided the issue in
  favour of the Hohenzollern monarchy.</p>

  <p>The loss of Silesia led Austria to look for "compensation" <span
  class="sidenote">Austria and Bavaria.</span> elsewhere. The most obvious
  direction in which this could be sought was in Bavaria, ruled by the
  decadent house of Wittelsbach, the secular rival of the house of Habsburg
  in southern Germany. The question of the annexation of Bavaria by
  conquest or exchange had occupied the minds of Austrian statesmen
  throughout the century: it would not only have removed a perpetual menace
  to the peace of Austria, but would have given to the Habsburg monarchy an
  overwhelming strength in South Germany. The matter came to an issue in
  1777, on the death of the elector Maximilian III. The heir was the
  elector palatine Charles Theodore, but Joseph II., who had been elected
  emperor in 1765, in succession to his father, and appointed co-regent
  with his mother&mdash;claimed the inheritance, and prepared to assert his
  claims by force. The result was the so-called War of Bavarian Succession.
  As a matter of fact, however, though the armies under Frederick and
  Joseph were face to face in the field, the affair was settled without
  actual fighting; Maria Theresa, fearing the chances of another struggle
  with Prussia, overruled her son at the last moment, and by the treaty of
  Teschen agreed to be content with the cession of the Quarter of the Inn
  (Innviertel) and some other districts.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the ambition of Catherine of Russia, and the war <span
  class="sidenote">Russia, Austria and the Ottoman Empire.</span> with
  Turkey by which the empire of the tsars was advanced to the Black Sea and
  threatened to establish itself south of the Danube, were productive of
  consequences of enormous importance to Austria in the East. Russian
  control of the Danube was a far more serious menace to Austria than the
  neighbourhood of the decadent Ottoman power; and for a while the policy
  of Austria towards the Porte underwent a change that foreshadowed her
  attitude towards the Eastern Question in the 19th century. In spite of
  the reluctance of Maria Theresa, Kaunitz, in July 1771, concluded a
  defensive alliance with the Porte. He would have exchanged this for an
  active co-operation with Turkey, could Frederick the Great have been
  persuaded to promise at least neutrality in the event of a Russo-Austrian
  War. But Frederick was unwilling to break with Russia, with whom he was
  negotiating the partition of Poland; Austria in these circumstances dared
  not take the offensive; and Maria Theresa was compelled to purchase the
  modification of the extreme claims of Russia in Turkey by agreeing to,
  and sharing in, the spoliation of Poland. <span
  class="sidenote">Partition of Poland.</span> Her own share of the spoils
  was the acquisition, by the first treaty of partition (August 5, 1772),
  of Galicia and Lodomeria. Turkey was left in the lurch; and Austrian
  troops even occupied portions of Moldavia, in order to secure the
  communication between the new Polish provinces and Transylvania. At
  Constantinople, too, Austria once more supported Russian policy, and was
  rewarded, in 1777, by the acquisition of Bukovina from Turkey. In Italy
  the influence of the House of Austria had been strengthened by the
  marriage of the archduke Ferdinand with the heiress of the d'Estes of
  Modena, and the establishment of the archduke Leopold in the grand-duchy
  of Tuscany.</p>

  <p>In internal affairs Maria Theresa may be regarded as the <span
  class="sidenote">Internal reforms under Maria Theresa.</span> practical
  founder of the unified Austrian state. The new system of centralization
  has already been referred to. It only remains to add that, in carrying
  out this system, Maria Theresa was too wise to fall into the errors
  afterwards made by her son and successor. She was no doctrinaire, and
  consistently acted on the principle once laid down by Machiavelli, that
  while changing the substance, the prince should be careful to preserve
  the form of old institutions. Alongside the new bureaucracy, the old
  estates survived in somnolent inactivity, and even in Hungary, though the
  ancient constitution was left untouched, the diet was only summoned four
  times during the reign, and reforms were carried out, without protest, by
  royal ordinance. It was under Maria Theresa, too, <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[v.03 p.0011]</span>that the attempt
  was first made to make German the official language of the whole
  monarchy; an attempt which was partly successful even in Hungary,
  especially so far as the army was concerned, though Latin remained the
  official tongue of the diet, the county-assemblies and the courts.</p>

  <p>The social, religious and educational reforms of Maria Theresa also
  mark her reign as the true epoch of transition from medieval to modern
  conditions in Austria. In religious matters the empress, though a devout
  Catholic and herself devoted to the Holy See, was carried away by the
  prevailing reaction, in which her ministers shared, against the
  pretensions of the papacy. The anti-papal tendency, known as Febronianism
  (<i>q.v.</i>), had made immense headway, not only among the laity but
  among the clergy in the Austrian dominions. By a new law, papal bulls
  could not be published without the consent of the crown, and the direct
  intercourse of the bishops with Rome was forbidden; the privileges of the
  religious orders were curtailed; and the education of the clergy was
  brought under state control. It was, however, only with reluctance that
  Maria Theresa agreed to carry out the papal bull suppressing the Society
  of Jesus; and, while declaring herself against persecution, she could
  never be persuaded to accept the views of Kaunitz and Joseph in favour of
  toleration. Parallel with the assertion of the rights of the state as
  against the church, was the revolution effected in the educational system
  of the monarchy. This, too, was taken from the control of the church; the
  universities were remodelled and modernized by the introduction of new
  faculties, the study of ecclesiastical law being transferred from that of
  theology to that of jurisprudence, and the elaborate system of elementary
  and secondary education was established, which survived with slight
  modification till 1869.</p>

  <p>The death of Maria Theresa in 1780 left Joseph II. free to <span
  class="sidenote">Joseph II. and "Josephinism."</span> attempt the drastic
  revolution from above, which had been restrained by the wise
  statesmanship of his mother. He was himself a strange incarnation at once
  of doctrinaire liberalism and the old Habsburg autocracy. Of the
  essential conditions of his empire he was constitutionally unable to form
  a conception. He was a disciple, not of Machiavelli, but of Rousseau; and
  his scattered dominions, divided by innumerable divergences of racial and
  class prejudice, and encumbered with traditional institutions to which
  the people clung with passionate conservatism, he regarded as so much
  vacant territory on which to build up his ideal state. He was, in fact, a
  Revolutionist who happened also to be an emperor. "Reason" and
  "enlightenment" were his watchwords; opposition to his wise measures he
  regarded as obscurantist and unreasonable, and unreason, if it proved
  stubborn, as a vice to be corrected with whips. In this spirit he at once
  set to work to reconstruct the state, on lines that strangely anticipated
  the principles of the Constituent Assembly of 1789. He refused to be
  crowned or to take the oath of the local constitutions, and divided the
  whole monarchy into thirteen departments, to be governed under a uniform
  system. In ecclesiastical matters his policy was also that of "reform
  from above," the complete subordination of the clergy to the state, and
  the severance of all effective ties with Rome. This treatment of the
  "Fakirs and Ulemas" (as he called them in his letters), who formed the
  most powerful element in the monarchy, would alone have ensured the
  failure of his plans, but failure was made certain by the introduction of
  the conscription, which turned even the peasants, whom he had done much
  to emancipate, against him. The threatened revolt of Hungary, and the
  actual revolt of Tirol and of the Netherlands (see <span
  class="sc">Belgium</span>: <i>History</i>) together with the disasters of
  the war with Turkey, forced him, before he died, to the formal reversal
  of the whole policy of reform.</p>

  <p>In his foreign policy Joseph II. had been scarcely less unhappy. In
  1784 he had resumed his plan of acquiring Bavaria for Austria by
  negotiating with the elector Charles Theodore its exchange for the
  Netherlands, which were to be erected for his benefit into a "Kingdom of
  Burgundy." The elector was not unwilling, but the scheme was wrecked by
  the opposition of the heir to the Bavarian throne, the duke of
  Zweibrücken, in response to whose appeal Frederick the Great formed, on
  the 23rd of July 1785, a confederation of German princes
  (<i>Fürstenbund</i>) for the purpose of opposing the threatened
  preponderance of Austria. Prussia was thus for the first time formally
  recognized as the protector of the German states against Austrian
  ambition, and had at the same time become the centre of an anti-Austrian
  alliance, which embraced Sweden, Poland and the maritime powers. In these
  circumstances the war with Turkey, on which Joseph embarked, in alliance
  with Russia, in 1788, would hardly have been justified by the most
  brilliant success. The first campaign, however, which he conducted in
  person was a dismal failure; the Turks followed the Austrian army,
  disorganized by disease, across the Danube, and though the transference
  of the command to the veteran marshal Loudon somewhat retrieved the
  initial disasters, his successes were more than counterbalanced by the
  alliance, concluded on the 31st of January 1790, between Prussia and
  Turkey. Three weeks later, on the 20th of February 1790, Joseph died
  broken-hearted.</p>

  <p>The situation needed all the statesmanship of the new ruler, <span
  class="sidenote">Leopold II.</span> Leopold II. This was less obvious in
  his domestic than in his foreign policy, though perhaps equally present.
  As grand-duke of Tuscany Leopold had won the reputation of an enlightened
  and liberal ruler; but meanwhile "Josephinism" had not been justified by
  its results, and the progress of the Revolution in France was beginning
  to scare even enlightened princes into reaction. Leopold, then, reverted
  to the traditional Habsburg methods; the old supremacy of the Church,
  regarded as the one effective bond of empire, was restored; and the
  <i>Einheitsstaat</i> was once more resolved into its elements, with the
  old machinery of diets and estates, and the old abuses. It was the
  beginning of that policy of "stability" associated later with Metternich,
  which was to last till the cataclysm of 1848. For the time, the policy
  was justified by its results. The spirit of revolutionary France had not
  yet touched the heart of the Habsburg empire, and national rivalries were
  expressed, not so much in expansive ambitions, as in a somnolent clinging
  to traditional privileges. Leopold, therefore, who made his début on the
  European stage as the executor of the ban of the Empire against the
  insurgent Liégeois, was free to pose as the champion of order against the
  Revolution, without needing to fear the resentment of his subjects. He
  played this role with consummate skill in the negotiations that led up to
  the treaty of Reichenbach (August 15, 1790), which ended the quarrel with
  Prussia and paved the way to the armistice of Giurgevo with Turkey
  (September 10). Leopold was now free to deal with the Low Countries,
  which were reduced to order before the end of the year. On the 4th of
  August 1791, was signed at Sistova the definitive peace with Turkey,
  which practically established the <i>status quo</i>.</p>

  <p>On the 6th of October 1700, Leopold had been crowned Roman <span
  class="sidenote">Austria and the French Revolution.</span> emperor at
  Frankfort, and it was as emperor, not as Habsburg, that he first found
  himself in direct antagonism to the France of the Revolution. The fact
  that Leopold's sister, Marie Antoinette, was the wife of Louis XVI. had
  done little to cement the Franco-Austrian alliance, which since 1763 had
  been practically non-existent; nor was it now the mainspring of his
  attitude towards revolutionary France. But by the decree of the 4th of
  August, which in the general abolition of feudal rights involved the
  possessions of many German princes <i>enclavés</i> in Alsace and
  Lorraine, the Constituent Assembly had made the first move in the war
  against the established European system. Leopold protested as sovereign
  of Germany; and the protest was soon enlarged into one made in the name
  of Europe. The circular letter of Count Kaunitz, dated the 6th of July
  1791, calling on the sovereigns to unite against the Revolution, was at
  once the beginning of the Concert of Europe, and in a sense the last
  manifesto of the Holy Roman Empire as "the centre of political unity."
  But the common policy proclaimed in the famous declaration of Pillnitz
  (August 27), was soon wrecked upon the particular interests of the
  powers. Both Austria and Prussia <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>[v.03 p.0012]</span>were much occupied with the Polish
  question, and to have plunged into a crusade against France would have
  been to have left Poland, where the new constitution had been proclaimed
  on the 3rd of May, to the mercy of Russia. Towards the further
  development of events in France, therefore, Leopold assumed at first a
  studiously moderate attitude; but his refusal to respond to the demand of
  the French government for the dispersal of the corps of <i>émigrés</i>
  assembled under the protection of the German princes on the frontier of
  France, and the insistence on the rights of princes dispossessed in
  Alsace and Lorraine, precipitated the crisis. On the 25th of January 1792
  the French Assembly adopted the decree declaring that, in the event of no
  satisfactory reply having been received from the emperor by the 1st of
  March, war should be declared. On the 7th of February Austria and Prussia
  signed at Berlin an offensive and defensive treaty of alliance. Thus was
  ushered in the series of stupendous events which were to change the face
  of Europe and profoundly to affect the destinies of Austria. Leopold
  himself did not live to see the beginning of the struggle; he died on the
  1st of March 1792, the day fixed by the Legislative Assembly as that on
  which the question of peace or war was to be decided.</p>

  <p>The events of the period that followed, in which Austria <span
  class="sidenote">Effects of the Revolutionary Wars.</span> necessarily
  played a conspicuous part, are dealt with elsewhere (see <span
  class="sc">Europe</span>, <span class="sc">French Revolutionary
  Wars</span>, <span class="sc">Napoleon</span>, <span
  class="sc">Napoleonic Campaigns</span>). Here it will only be necessary
  to mention those which form permanent landmarks in the progressive
  conformation of the Austrian monarchy. Such was the second partition of
  Poland (January 23, 1793), which eliminated the "buffer state" on which
  Austrian statesmanship had hitherto laid such importance, and brought the
  Austrian and Russian frontiers into contact. Such, too, was the treaty of
  Campo Formio (October 17, 1797) which ended the first revolutionary war.
  By this treaty the loss of the Belgian provinces was confirmed, and
  though Austria gained Venice, the establishment of French preponderance
  in the rest of Italy made a breach in the tradition of Habsburg supremacy
  in the peninsula, which was to have its full effect only in the struggles
  of the next century. The rise of Napoleon, and his masterful interference
  in Germany, produced a complete and permanent revolution in the relations
  of Austria to the German states. The campaigns which issued in the treaty
  of Lunéville (February 9, 1801) practically sealed the fate of the old
  Empire. Even were the venerable name to survive, it was felt that it
  would pass, by the election of the princes now tributary to France, from
  the house of Habsburg to that of Bonaparte. <span class="sidenote">The
  "Empire of Austria."</span> Francis II. determined to forestall the
  possible indignity of the subordination of his family to an upstart
  dynasty. On the 14th of May 1804, Napoleon was proclaimed emperor of the
  French; on the 11th of August Francis II. assumed the style of Francis
  I., hereditary emperor of Austria. <span class="sidenote">End of the Holy
  Roman Empire.</span> Two years later, when the defeat of Austerlitz had
  led to the treaty of Pressburg (January 1st, 1806) by which Austria lost
  Venice and Tirol, and Napoleon's Confederation of the Rhine had broken
  the unity of Germany, Francis formally abdicated the title and functions
  of Holy Roman emperor (August 6, 1806).</p>

  <p>Austria had to undergo further losses and humiliations, notably by the
  treaty of Vienna (1809), before the outcome of Napoleon's Russian
  campaign in 1812 gave her the opportunity for recuperation and revenge.
  The skilful diplomacy of Metternich, who was now at the head of the
  Austrian government, enabled Austria to take full advantage of the
  situation created by the disaster to Napoleon's arms. His object was to
  recover Austria's lost possessions and if possible to add to them, a
  policy which did not necessarily involve the complete overthrow of the
  French emperor. Austria, therefore, refused to join the alliance between
  Russia and Prussia signed on the 17th of March 1813, but pressed on her
  armaments so as to be ready in any event. Her opportunity came after the
  defeats of the Allies at Lützen and Bautzen and the conclusion of an
  armistice at Pleswitz. Between 200,000 and 300,000 Austrian troops were
  massed in Bohemia; and Austria took up the rôle of mediator, prepared to
  throw the weight of her support into the scale of whichever side should
  prove most amenable to her claims. The news of the battle of Vittoria,
  following on the reluctance of Napoleon to listen to demands involving
  the overthrow of the whole of his political system in Central Europe,
  decided Austria in favour of the Allies. By this fateful decision
  Napoleon's fall was assured. By the treaty of Trachenberg (July 12, 1813)
  the Grand Alliance was completed; on the 16th, 17th and 18th of October
  the battle of Leipzig was fought; and the victorious advance into France
  was begun, which issued, on the 11th of April 1814, in Napoleon's
  abdication. (See <span class="sc">Napoleon</span>, <span
  class="sc">Napoleonic Campaigns</span>, <span
  class="sc">Europe</span>.)</p>

  <p>It was a recognition of the decisive part played by Austria <span
  class="sidenote">Congress of Vienna.</span> in these great events that
  Vienna was chosen as the scene of the great international congress
  summoned (September 1814) for the purpose of re-establishing the balance
  of power in Europe, which Napoleon's conquests had upset. An account of
  the congress is given elsewhere (see <span class="sc">Vienna, Congress
  of</span>). The result for Austria was a triumphant vindication of
  Metternich's diplomacy. He had, it is true, been unable to prevent the
  retention of the grand-duchy of Warsaw by Alexander of Russia; but with
  the aid of Great Britain and France (secret treaty of January 3, 1815) he
  had frustrated the efforts of Prussia to absorb the whole of Saxony,
  Bavaria was forced to disgorge the territories gained for her by Napoleon
  at Austria's expense, Illyria and Dalmatia were regained, and Lombardy
  was added to Venetia to constitute a kingdom under the Habsburg crown;
  while in the whole Italian peninsula French was replaced by Austrian
  influence. In Germany the settlement was even more fateful for Austria's
  future. The Holy Empire, in spite of the protests of the Holy See, was
  not restored, Austria preferring the loose confederation of sovereign
  states (<i>Staatenbund</i>) actually constituted under her presidency.
  Such a body, Metternich held, "powerful for defence, powerless for
  offence," would form a guarantee of the peace of central Europe&mdash;and
  of the preponderance of Austria; and in its councils Austrian diplomacy,
  backed by the weight of the Habsburg power beyond the borders of Germany,
  would exercise a greater influence than any possible prestige derived
  from a venerable title that had become a by-word for the union of
  unlimited pretensions with practical impotence. Moreover, to the refusal
  to revive the Empire&mdash;which shattered so many patriotic hopes in
  Germany&mdash;Austria added another decision yet more fateful. By
  relinquishing her claim to the Belgian provinces and other outlying
  territories in western Germany, and by acquiescing in the establishment
  of Prussia in the Rhine provinces, she abdicated to Prussia her position
  as the bulwark of Germany against France, and hastened the process of her
  own gravitation towards the Slavonic East to which the final impetus was
  given in 1866.</p>

  <p>In order to understand the foreign policy of Austria, inseparably
  <span class="sidenote">Internal affairs of Austria under Francis II. and
  Metternich.</span> associated with the name of Metternich, during the
  period from the close of the congress of Vienna to the outbreak of the
  revolutions of 1848, it is necessary to know something of the internal
  conditions of the monarchy before and during this time. In 1792 Leopold
  II. had been succeeded by his son Francis II. His popular designation of
  "our good Kaiser Franz" this monarch owed to a certain simplicity of
  address and <i>bonhomie</i> which pleased the Viennese, certainly not to
  his serious qualities as a ruler. He shared to the full the autocratic
  temper of the Habsburgs, their narrow-mindedness and their religious and
  intellectual obscurantism; and the qualities which would have made him a
  kindly, if somewhat tyrannical, father of a family, and an excellent head
  clerk, were hardly those required by the conditions of the Austrian
  monarchy during a singularly critical period of its history.</p>

  <p>The personal character of the emperor, moreover, gained a special
  importance owing to the modifications that were made in the
  administrative system of the empire. This had been originally organized
  in a series of departments: Aulic chanceries for Austria, for Hungary and
  Transylvania, a general Aulic chamber for finance, domains, mines, trade,
  post, &amp;c., an Aulic council <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>[v.03 p.0013]</span>of war, a general directory of
  accounts, and a chancery of the household, court and state. The heads of
  all these departments had the rank of secretaries of state and met in
  council under the royal presidency. In course of time, however, this body
  became too unwieldy for an effective cabinet, and Maria Theresa
  established the council of state. During the early years of the reign of
  Francis, the emperor kept himself in touch with the various departments
  by means of a cabinet minister; but he had a passion for detail, and
  after 1805 he himself undertook the function of keeping the
  administration together. At the same time he had no personal contact with
  ministers, who might communicate with him only in writing, and for months
  together never met for the discussion of business. The council of state
  was, moreover, itself soon enlarged and subdivided; and in course of time
  the emperor alone represented any synthesis of the various departments of
  the administration. The jurisdiction of the heads of departments,
  moreover, was strictly defined, and all that lay outside this was
  reserved for the imperial decision. Whatever was covered by established
  precedent could be settled by the department at once; but matters falling
  outside such precedent, however insignificant, had to be referred to the
  throne.<a name="FnAnchor_022" href="#Footnote_022"><sup>[2]</sup></a> A
  system so inelastic, and so deadening to all initiative, could have but
  one result. Gradually the officials, high and low, subjected to an
  elaborate system of checks, refused to take any responsibility whatever;
  and the minutest administrative questions were handed up, through all the
  stages of the bureaucratic hierarchy, to be shelved and forgotten in the
  imperial cabinet. For Francis could not possibly himself deal with all
  the questions of detail arising in his vast empire, even had he desired
  to do so. In fact, his attitude towards all troublesome problems was
  summed up in his favourite phrase, "Let us sleep upon it": questions
  unanswered would answer themselves.</p>

  <p>The result was the gradual atrophy of the whole administrative
  machine. The Austrian government was not consciously tyrannical, even in
  Italy; and Francis himself, though determined to be absolute, intended
  also to be paternal. Nor would the cruelties inflicted on the bolder
  spirits who dared to preach reform, which made the Austrian government a
  by-word among the nations, alone have excited the passionate spirit of
  revolt which carried all before it in 1848. The cause of this is to be
  sought rather in the daily friction of a system which had ceased to be
  efficient and only succeeded in irritating the public opinion it was
  powerless to curb.</p>

  <p>Metternich himself was fully conscious of the evil. He recognized that
  the fault of the government lay in the fact that it did not govern, and
  he deplored that his own function, in a decadent age, was but "to prop up
  mouldering institutions." He was not constitutionally averse from change;
  and he was too clear-sighted not to see that, sooner or later, change was
  inevitable. But his interest was in the fascinating game of diplomacy; he
  was ambitious of playing the leading part on the great stage of
  international politics; and he was too consummate a courtier to risk the
  loss of the imperial favour by any insistence on unpalatable reforms,
  which, after all, would perhaps only reveal the necessity for the
  complete revolution which he feared.</p>

  <p>The alternative was to use the whole force of the government to keep
  things as they were. The disintegrating force of the ever-simmering
  racial rivalries could be kept in check by the army; Hungarian regiments
  garrisoned Italy, Italian regiments guarded Galicia, Poles occupied
  Austria, and Austrians Hungary. The peril from the infiltration of
  "revolutionary" ideas from without was met by the erection round the
  Austrian dominions of a Chinese wall of tariffs and censors, which had,
  however, no more success than is usual with such expedients.<a
  name="FnAnchor_023" href="#Footnote_023"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The peril
  from the independent growth of Liberalism within was guarded against by a
  rigid supervision of the press and the re-establishment of clerical
  control over education. Music alone flourished, free from government
  interference; but, curiously enough, the movements, in Bohemia, Croatia
  and elsewhere, for the revival of the national literatures and
  languages&mdash;which were to issue in the most difficult problem facing
  the Austrian government at the opening of the 20th century&mdash;were
  encouraged in exalted circles, as tending to divert attention from
  political to purely scientific interests. Meanwhile the old system of
  provincial diets and estates was continued or revived (in 1816 in Tirol
  and Vorarlberg, 1817 in Galicia, 1818 in Carniola, 1828 in the circle of
  Salzburg), but they were in no sense representative, clergy and nobles
  alone being eligible, with a few delegates from the towns, and they had
  practically no functions beyond registering the imperial decrees,
  relative to recruiting or taxation, and dealing with matters of local
  police.<a name="FnAnchor_024" href="#Footnote_024"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
  Even the ancient right of petition was seldom exercised, and then only to
  meet with the imperial disfavour. And this stagnation of the
  administration was accompanied, as might have been expected, by economic
  stagnation. Agriculture languished, hampered, as in France before the
  Revolution, by the feudal privileges of a noble caste which no longer
  gave any equivalent service to the state; trade was strangled by the
  system of high tariffs at the frontier and internal <i>octrois</i>; and
  finally public credit was shaken to its foundations by lavish issues of
  paper money and the neglect to publish the budget.</p>

  <p>The maintenance within the empire of a system so artificial <span
  class="sidenote">Metternich's policy of stability.</span> and so unsound,
  involved in foreign affairs the policy of preventing the success of any
  movements by which it might be threatened. The triumph of Liberal
  principles or of national aspirations in Germany, or elsewhere in Europe,
  might easily, as the events of 1848 proved, shatter the whole rotten
  structure of the Habsburg monarchy, which survived only owing to the
  apathy of the populations it oppressed. This, then, is the explanation of
  the system of "stability" which Metternich succeeded in imposing for
  thirty years upon Europe. If he persuaded Frederick William III. that the
  grant of a popular constitution would be fatal to the Prussian monarchy,
  this was through no love of Prussia; the Carlsbad Decrees and the Vienna
  Final Act were designed to keep Germany quiet, lest the sleep of Austria
  should be disturbed; the lofty claims of the Troppau Protocol were but to
  cover an Austrian aggression directed to purely Austrian ends: and in the
  Eastern Question, the moral support given to the "legitimate" authority
  of the sultan over the "rebel" Greeks was dictated solely by the interest
  of Austria in maintaining the integrity of Turkey. (See <span
  class="sc">Europe</span>: <i>History</i>; <span
  class="sc">Germany</span>: <i>History</i>; <span class="sc">Alexander
  I.</span> of Russia; <span class="sc">Metternich</span>, &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>Judged by the standard of its own aims Metternich's diplomacy was, on
  the whole, completely successful. For fifteen years after the congress of
  Vienna, in spite of frequent alarms, the peace of Europe was not
  seriously disturbed; and even in 1830, the revolution at Paris found no
  echo in the great body of the Austrian dominions. The isolated revolts in
  Italy were easily suppressed; and the insurrection of Poland, though it
  provoked the lively sympathy of the Magyars and Czechs, led to no actual
  movement in the Habsburg states. For a moment, indeed, Metternich had
  meditated taking advantage of the popular feeling to throw the weight of
  Austria into the scale in favour of the Poles, and thus, by
  re-establishing a Polish kingdom under Austrian influence, to restore the
  barrier between the two empires which the partition of Poland had
  destroyed. But cautious counsels prevailed, and by the victory of the
  Russian arms the <i>status quo</i> was restored (see <span
  class="sc">Poland</span>).</p>

  <p>The years that followed were not wanting in signs of the coming <span
  class="sidenote">Ferdinand I. 1835-1848.</span> storm. On the 2nd of
  March 1835 Francis I. died, and was succeeded by his son Ferdinand I. The
  new emperor was personally amiable, but so enfeebled by epilepsy as to be
  incapable of ruling; a veiled regency had to be constituted to carry on
  the government, and the vices of the administration were further
  accentuated by weakness and divided counsels at the centre. Under these
  circumstances <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[v.03 p.0014]</span>popular discontent made rapid
  headway. The earliest symptoms of political agitation were in Hungary,
  where the diet began to show signs of vigorous life, and the growing Slav
  separatist movements, especially in the south of the kingdom, were
  rousing the old spirit of Magyar ascendancy (see <span
  class="sc">Hungary</span>: <i>History</i>). For everywhere the Slav
  populations were growing restive under the German-Magyar domination. In
  Bohemia the Czech literary movement had developed into an organized
  resistance to the established order, which was attacked under the
  disguise of a criticism of the English administration in Ireland.
  "Repeal" became the watchword of Bohemian, as of Irish, nationalists (see
  <span class="sc">Bohemia</span>). Among the southern Slavs the "Illyrian"
  movement, voiced from 1836 onward in the <i>Illyrian National Gazette</i>
  of Ljudevit Gaj, was directed in the first instance to a somewhat shadowy
  Pan-Slav union, which, on the interference of the Austrian government in
  1844, was exchanged for the more definite object of a revival of "the
  Triune Kingdom" (Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia) independent of the
  Hungarian crown (see <span class="sc">Croatia</span>, &amp;c.). In the
  German provinces also, in spite of Metternich's censors and police, the
  national movements in Germany had gained an entrance, and, as the
  revolution of 1848 in Vienna was to show, the most advanced revolutionary
  views were making headway.</p>

  <p>The most important of all the symptoms of the approaching <span
  class="sidenote">Galician Rising, 1846.</span> cataclysm was, however,
  the growing unrest among the peasants. As had been proved in France in
  1789, and was again to be shown in Russia in 1906, the success of any
  political revolution depended ultimately upon the attitude of the peasant
  class. In this lies the main significance of the rising in Galicia in
  1846. This was in its origin a Polish nationalist movement, hatched in
  the little independent republic of Cracow. As such it had little
  importance; though, owing to the incompetence of the Austrian commander,
  the Poles gained some initial successes. More fateful was the attitude of
  the Orthodox Ruthenian peasantry, who were divided from their Catholic
  Polish over-lords by centuries of religious and feudal oppression. The
  Poles had sought, by lavish promises, to draw them into their ranks;
  their reply was to rise in support of the Austrian government. In the
  fight at Gdow (February 26th), where Benedek laid the foundations of the
  military reputation that was to end so tragically at Königgrätz, flail
  and scythe wrought more havoc in the rebel ranks than the Austrian
  musketry. Since, in spite of this object-lesson, the Polish nobles still
  continued their offers, the peasants consulted the local Austrian
  authorities as to what course they should take; and the local
  authorities, unaccustomed to arriving at any decision without consulting
  Vienna, practically gave them <i>carte blanche</i> to do as they liked. A
  hideous <i>jacquerie</i> followed for three or four days; during which
  cartloads of dead were carried into Tarnow, where the peasants received a
  reward for every "rebel" brought in.</p>

  <p>This affair was not only a scandal for which the Austrian government,
  through its agents, was responsible; but it placed the authorities at
  Vienna in a serious dilemma. For the Ruthenians, elated by their victory,
  refused to return to work, and demanded the abolition of all feudal
  obligations as the reward of their loyalty. To refuse this claim would
  have meant the indefinite prolongation of the crisis; to concede it would
  have been to invite the peasantry of the whole empire to put forth
  similar demands on pain of a general rising. On the 13th of April 1846 an
  imperial decree abolished some of the more burdensome feudal obligations;
  but this concession was greeted with so fierce an outcry, as an
  authoritative endorsement of the atrocities, that it was again revoked,
  and Count Franz von Stadion was sent to restore order in Galicia. The
  result was, that the peasants saw that though their wrongs were admitted,
  their sole hope of redress lay in a change of government, and added the
  dead weight of their resentment to the forces making for revolution. It
  was the union of the agrarian with the nationalist movements that made
  the downfall of the Austrian system inevitable.</p>

  <p>The material for the conflagration in Austria was thus all <span
  class="sidenote">Revolutions of 1848.</span> prepared when in February
  1848 the fall of Louis Philippe fanned into a blaze the smouldering fires
  of revolution throughout Europe. On the 3rd of March, Kossuth, in the
  diet at Pressburg, delivered the famous speech which was the declaration
  of war of Hungarian Liberalism against the Austrian system. "From the
  charnel-house of the Vienna cabinet," he exclaimed, "a pestilential air
  breathes on us, which dulls our nerves and paralyses the flight of our
  spirit." Hungary liberated was to become the centre of freedom for all
  the races under the Austrian crown, and the outcome was to be a new
  "fraternization of the Austrian peoples." In the enthusiasm of the moment
  the crucial question of the position to be occupied by the conflicting
  nationalities in this "fraternal union" was overlooked. Germanism had so
  far served as the basis of the Austrian system, not as a national ideal,
  but because "it formed a sort of unnational mediating, and common element
  among the contradictory and clamorous racial tendencies." But with the
  growth of the idea of German unity, Germanism had established a new
  ideal, of which the centre lay beyond the boundaries of the Austrian
  monarchy, and which was bound to be antagonistic to the aspirations of
  other races. The new doctrine of the fraternization of the Austrian races
  would inevitably soon come into conflict with the traditional German
  ascendancy strengthened by the new sentiment of a united Germany. It was
  on this rock that, both in Austria and in Germany, the revolution
  suffered shipwreck.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile events progressed rapidly. On the 11th of March a meeting of
  "young Czechs" at Prague drew up a petition embodying nationalist and
  liberal demands; and on the same day the diet of Lower Austria petitioned
  the crown to summon a meeting of the delegates of the diets to set the
  Austrian finances in order. To this last proposal the government, next
  day, gave its consent. But in the actual temper of the Viennese the
  slightest concession was dangerous. The hall of the diet was invaded by a
  mob of students and workmen, Kossuth's speech was read and its proposals
  adopted as the popular programme, and the members of the diet were forced
  to lead a tumultuous procession to the Hofburg, to force the assent of
  the government to a petition based on the catch-words of the Revolution.
  <span class="sidenote">Fall of Metternich, March 13, 1848.</span> The
  authorities, taken by surprise, were forced to temporize and agreed to
  lay the petition before the emperor. Meanwhile round the hall of the diet
  a riot had broken out; the soldiers intervened and blood was shed. The
  middle classes now joined the rebels; and the riots had become a
  revolution. Threatened by the violence of the mob, Metternich, on the
  evening of the 13th of March, escaped from the Hofburg and passed into
  exile in England.</p>

  <p>The fall of Metternich was the signal for the outburst of the storm,
  not in Austria only, but throughout central Europe. In Hungary, on the
  31st of March, the government was forced to consent to a new constitution
  which virtually erected Hungary into an independent state. On the 8th of
  April a separate constitution was promised to Bohemia; and if the
  petition of the Croats for a similar concession was rejected, this was
  due to the armed mob of Vienna, which was in close alliance with Kossuth
  and the Magyars. The impotence of the Austrian government in this crisis
  was due to the necessity of keeping the bulk of the Austrian forces in
  Italy, where the news of Metternich's fall had also led to a concerted
  rising against the Habsburg rule (see <span class="sc">Italy</span>).
  Upon the fortunes of war in the peninsula depended the ultimate issue of
  the revolutions so far as Austria was concerned.</p>

  <p>The army and the prestige of the imperial tradition were, in fact, the
  two sheet-anchors that enabled the Habsburg monarchy to weather the
  storm. For the time the latter was the only one available; but it proved
  invaluable, especially in Germany, in preventing any settlement, until
  Radetzky's victory of Novara had set free the army, and thus once more
  enabled Austria to back her policy by force. The Austrian government, in
  no position to refuse, had consented to send delegates from its German
  provinces to the parliament of united Germany, which met at Frankfort on
  the 18th of May 1848. The question at <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[v.03 p.0015]</span>once arose of
  the place of the Austrian monarchy in united Germany. Were only its
  German provinces to be included? Or was it to be incorporated whole? As
  to the first, the Austrian government would not listen to the suggestion
  of a settlement which would have split the monarchy in half and subjected
  it to a double allegiance. As to the second, German patriots could not
  stomach the inclusion in Germany of a vast non-German population. The
  dilemma was from the first so obvious that the parliament would have done
  well to have recognized at once that the only possible solution was that
  arrived at, after the withdrawal of the Austrian delegates, by the
  exclusion of Austria altogether and the offer of the crown of Germany to
  Frederick William of Prussia. But the shadow of the Holy Empire,
  immemorially associated with the house of Habsburg, still darkened the
  counsels of German statesmen. The Austrian archduke John had been
  appointed regent, pending the election of an emperor; and the political
  leaders could neither break loose from the tradition of Austrian
  hegemony, nor reconcile themselves with the idea of a mutilated Germany,
  till it was too late, and Austria was once more in a position to
  re-establish the system devised by her diplomacy at the congress of
  Vienna. (See <span class="sc">Germany</span>: <i>History.</i>)</p>

  <p>This fatal procrastination was perhaps not without excuse, in view of
  the critical situation of the Austrian monarchy during 1848. For months
  after the fall of Metternich Austria was practically without a central
  government. Vienna itself, where on the 14th of March the establishment
  of a National Guard was authorized by the emperor, was ruled by a
  committee of students and citizens, who arrogated to themselves a voice
  in imperial affairs, and imposed their will on the distracted ministry.
  On the 15th of March the government proposed to summon a central
  committee of local diets; but this was far from satisfying public
  opinion, and on the 25th of April a constitution was proclaimed,
  including the whole monarchy with the exception of Hungary and
  Lombardo-Venetia. This was, however, met by vigorous protests from Czechs
  and Poles, while its provisions for a partly nominated senate, and the
  indirect election of deputies, excited the wrath of radical Vienna.
  Committees of students and national guards were formed; on the 13th of
  May a Central Committee was established; and on the 15th a fresh
  insurrection broke out, as a result of which the government once more
  yielded, recognizing the Central Committee, admitting the right of the
  National Guard to take an active part in politics, and promising the
  convocation of a National Convention on the basis of a single chamber
  elected by universal suffrage. On the 17th the emperor left Vienna for
  Innsbruck "for the benefit of his health," and thence, on the 20th,
  issued a proclamation in which he cast himself on the loyalty of his
  faithful provinces, and, while confirming the concessions of March,
  ignored those of the 15th of May. The flight of the emperor had led to a
  revulsion of feeling in Vienna; but the issue of the proclamation and the
  attempt of the government to disperse the students by closing the
  university, led to a fresh outbreak on the 26th. Once more the ministry
  conceded all the demands of the insurgents, and even went so far as to
  hand over the public treasury and the responsibility of keeping order to
  a newly constituted Committee of Public Safety.</p>

  <p>The tide was now, however, on the turn. The Jacobinism <span
  class="sidenote">National movements.</span> of the Vienna democracy was
  not really representative of any widespread opinion even in the German
  parts of Austria, while its loud-voiced Germanism excited the lively
  opposition of the other races. Each of these had taken advantage of the
  March troubles to press its claims, and everywhere the government had
  shown the same yielding spirit. In Bohemia, where the attempt to hold
  elections for the Frankfort parliament had broken down on the opposition
  of the Czechs and the conservative German aristocracy, a separate
  constitution had been proclaimed on the 8th of April; on March the 23rd
  the election by the diet of Agram of Baron Joseph Jellachich as ban of
  Croatia was confirmed, as a concession to the agitation among the
  southern Slavs; on the 18th of March Count Stadion had proclaimed a new
  constitution for Galicia. Even where, as in the case of the Serbs and
  Rumans, the government had given no formal sanction to the national
  claims, the emperor was regarded as the ultimate guarantee of their
  success; and deputations from the various provinces poured into Innsbruck
  protesting their loyalty.</p>

  <p>To say that the government deliberately adopted the Machiavellian
  policy of mastering the revolution by setting race against race would be
  to pay too high a compliment to its capacity. The policy was forced upon
  it; and was only pursued consciously when it became obvious. Count
  Stadion began it in Galicia, where, before bombarding insurgent Cracow
  into submission (April 26), he had won over the Ruthenian peasants by the
  abolition of feudal dues and by forwarding a petition to the emperor for
  the official recognition of their language alongside Polish. But the
  great object lesson was furnished by the events in Prague, where the
  quarrel between Czechs and Germans, radicals and conservatives, issued on
  the 12th of June in a rising of the Czech students and populace. The
  suppression of this rising, and with it of the revolution in Bohemia, on
  the 16th of June, by Prince Windischgrätz, was not only the first victory
  of the army, but was the signal for the outbreak of a universal race war,
  in which the idea of constitutional liberty was sacrificed to the bitter
  spirit of national rivalry. The parliament at Frankfort hailed
  Windischgrätz as a national hero, and offered to send troops to his aid;
  the German revolutionists in Vienna welcomed every success of Radetzky's
  arms in Italy as a victory for Germanism. The natural result was to drive
  the Slav nationalities to the side of the imperial government, since,
  whether at Vienna or at Budapest, the radicals were their worst
  enemies.</p>

  <p>The 16th of June had been fatal to the idea of an independent Bohemia,
  fatal also to Pan-Slav dreams. To the Czechs the most immediate peril now
  seemed that from the German parliament, and in the interests of their
  nationality they were willing to join the Austrian government in the
  struggle against German liberalism. The Bohemian diet, summoned for the
  19th, never met. Writs were issued in Bohemia for the election to the
  Austrian Reichsrath; and when, on the 10th of July, this assembled, the
  Slav deputies were found to be in a majority. This fact, which was to
  lead to violent trouble later, was at first subordinate to other issues,
  of which the most important was the question of the emancipation of the
  peasants. After long debates the law abolishing feudal services&mdash;the
  sole permanent outcome of the revolution&mdash;was carried on the 31st of
  August, and on the 7th of September received the imperial consent. The
  peasants thus received all that they desired, and their vast weight was
  henceforth thrown into the scale of the government against the
  revolution.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the alliance between the Slav nationalities and the <span
  class="sidenote">Jellachich and "Illyrism."</span> conservative elements
  within the empire had found a powerful representative in Jellachich, the
  ban of Croatia. At first, indeed, his activity had been looked at askance
  at Innsbruck, as but another force making for disintegration. He had
  apparently identified himself with the "Illyrian" party, had broken off
  all communications with the Hungarian government, and, in spite of an
  imperial edict issued in response to the urgency of Batthyáni, had
  summoned a diet to Agram, which on the 9th of June decreed the separation
  of the "Triune Kingdom" from Hungary. The imperial government, which
  still hoped for Magyar aid against the Viennese revolutionists,
  repudiated the action of the ban, accused him of disobedience and
  treason, and deprived him of his military rank. But his true motives were
  soon apparent; his object was to play off the nationalism of the
  "Illyrians" against the radicalism of Magyars and Germans, and thus to
  preserve his province for the monarchy; and the Hungarian radicals played
  into his hands. The fate of the Habsburg empire depended upon the issue
  of the campaign in Italy, which would have been lost by the withdrawal of
  the Magyar and Croatian regiments; and the Hungarian government chose
  this critical moment to tamper with the relations of the army to the
  monarchy. In May a National Guard had been established; <!-- Page 16
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[v.03 p.0016]</span>and the
  soldiers of the line were invited to join this, with the promise of
  higher pay; on the 1st of June the garrison of Pest took the oath to the
  Constitution. On the 10th Jellachich issued a proclamation to the
  Croatian regiments in Italy, bidding them remain and fight for the
  emperor and the common Fatherland. His loyalty to the tradition of the
  imperial army was thus announced, and the alliance was cemented between
  the army and the southern Slavs.</p>

  <p>Jellachich, who had gone to Innsbruck to lay the Slav view before the
  emperor, was allowed to return to Agram, though not as yet formally
  reinstated. Here the diet passed a resolution denouncing the dual system
  and demanding the restoration of the union of the empire. Thus was
  proclaimed the identity of the Slav and the conservative points of view;
  the radical "Illyrian" assembly had done its work, and on the 9th of July
  Jellachich, while declaring it "permanent," prorogued it indefinitely
  "with a paternal greeting," on the ground that the safety of the
  Fatherland depended now "more upon physical than upon moral force." The
  diet thus prorogued never met again. Absolute master of the forces of the
  banat, Jellachich now waited until the intractable politicians of Pest
  should give him the occasion and the excuse for setting the imperial army
  in motion against them.</p>

  <p>The occasion was not to be long postponed. Every day the <span
  class="sidenote">Hungary.</span> rift between the dominant radical
  element in the Hungarian parliament and imperial court was widened.
  Kossuth and his followers were evidently aiming at the complete
  separation of Hungary from Austria; they were in sympathy, if not in
  alliance, with the German radicals in Vienna and Frankfort; they were
  less than half-hearted in their support of the imperial arms in Italy.
  The imperial government, pressed by the Magyar nationalists to renounce
  Jellachich and all his works, equivocated and procrastinated, while
  within its councils the idea of a centralized state, to replace the loose
  federalism of the old empire, slowly took shape under the pressure of the
  military party. It was encouraged by the news from Italy, where, on the
  25th of July, Radetzky had won the battle of Custozza, and on the 6th of
  August the Austrian standard once more floated over the towers of Milan.
  At Custozza Magyar hussars, Croats from the Military Frontier, and
  Tirolese sharpshooters had fought side by side. The possibility was
  obvious of combating the radical and nationalist revolution by means of
  the army, with its spirit of comradeship in arms and its imperialist
  tradition.</p>

  <p>So early as the beginning of July, Austrian officers, with the
  permission of the minister of war, had joined the Serb insurgents who,
  under Stratemirovi&#x107;, were defying the Magyar power in the banat. By
  the end of August the breach between the Austrian and Hungarian
  governments was open and complete; on the 4th of September Jellachich was
  reinstated in all his honours, and on the 11th he crossed the Drave to
  the invasion of Hungary. The die was thus cast; and, though efforts
  continued to be made to arrange matters, the time for moderate counsels
  was passed. The conservative leaders of the Hungarian nationalists,
  Eötvös and Deák, retired from public life; and, though Batthyáni
  consented to remain in office, the slender hope that this gave of peace
  was ruined by the flight of the palatine (September 24) and the murder of
  Count Lamberg, the newly appointed commissioner and commander-in-chief in
  Hungary, by the mob at Pest (September 27). The appeal was now to arms;
  and the fortunes of the Habsburg monarchy were bound up with the fate of
  the war in Hungary (see <span class="sc">Hungary</span>:
  <i>History</i>).</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, renewed trouble had broken out in Vienna, where the radical
  populace was in conflict alike with the government and with the Slav
  majority of the Reichsrath. The German democrats appealed for aid to the
  Hungarian government; but the Magyar passion for constitutional legality
  led to delay, and before the Hungarian advance could be made effective,
  it was too late. On the 7th of October the emperor Ferdinand had fled
  from Schönbrunn to Olmütz, a Slav district, whence he issued a
  proclamation inviting whoever loved "Austria and freedom" to rally round
  the throne. On the 11th Windischgrätz proclaimed his intention of
  marching against rebellious Vienna, and on the 16th an imperial rescript
  appointed him a field-marshal and commander-in-chief of all the Austrian
  armies except that of Italy. Meanwhile, of the Reichsrath, the members of
  the Right and the Slav majority had left Vienna and announced a meeting
  of the diet at Brünn for the 20th of October; all that remained in the
  capital was a rump of German radicals, impotent in the hands of the
  proletariat and the students. The defence of the city was hastily
  organized under Bern, an ex-officer of Napoleon; but in the absence of
  help from Hungary it was futile. On the 28th of October Windischgrätz
  began his attack; on the 1st of November he was master of the city.</p>

  <p>The fall of revolutionary Vienna practically involved that of the
  revolution in Frankfort and in Pest. From Italy the congratulations of
  Radetzky's victorious army came to Windischgrätz, from Russia the even
  more significant commendations of the emperor Nicholas. The moral of the
  victory was painted for all the world by the military execution of Robert
  Blum, whose person, as a deputy of the German parliament, should have
  been sacrosanct. The time had, indeed, not yet come to attempt any
  conspicuous breach with the constitutional principle; but the new
  ministry was such as the imperial sentiment would approve, inimical to
  the German ideals of Frankfort, devoted to the traditions of the Habsburg
  monarchy. At its head was Prince Felix Schwarzenberg (<i>q.v.</i>), the
  "army-diplomat," a statesman at once strong and unscrupulous. On the 27th
  of November a proclamation announced that the continuation of Austria as
  a united state was necessary both for Germany and for Europe. <span
  class="sidenote">Accession of Francis Joseph, 1848</span> On the 2nd of
  December the emperor Ferdinand, bound by too many personal obligations to
  the revolutionary parties to serve as a useful instrument for the new
  policy, abdicated, and his nephew Francis Joseph ascended the throne. The
  proclamation of the new emperor was a gage of defiance thrown down to
  Magyars and German unionists alike: "Firmly determined to preserve
  undimmed the lustre of our crown," it ran, "but prepared to share our
  rights with the representatives of our peoples, we trust that with God's
  aid and in common with our peoples we shall succeed in uniting all the
  countries and races of the monarchy in one great body politic."</p>

  <p>While the Reichsrath, transferred to Kremsier, was discussing
  "fundamental rights" and the difficult question of how to reconcile the
  theoretical unity with the actual dualism of the empire, the knot was
  being cut by the sword on the plains of Hungary. The Hungarian retreat
  after the bloody battle of Kapolna (February 26-27, 1849) was followed by
  the dissolution of the Kremsier assembly, and a proclamation in which the
  emperor announced his intention of granting a constitution to the whole
  monarchy "one and indivisible." On the 4th of March the constitution was
  published; but it proved all but as distasteful to Czechs and Croats as
  to the Magyars, and the speedy successes of the Hungarian arms made it,
  for the while, a dead letter. It needed the intervention of the emperor
  Nicholas, in the loftiest spirit of the Holy Alliance, before even an
  experimental unity of the Habsburg dominions could be established (see
  <span class="sc">Hungary</span>: <i>History</i>).</p>

  <p>The capitulation of Világos, which ended the Hungarian insurrection,
  gave Schwarzenberg a free hand for completing the work of restoring the
  <i>status quo ante</i> and the influence of Austria in Germany. The
  account of the process by which this was accomplished belongs to the
  history of Germany (<i>q.v.</i>). Here it will suffice to say that the
  terms of the Convention of Olmütz (September 29, 1850) seemed at the time
  a complete triumph for Austria over Prussia. As a matter of fact,
  however, the convention was, in the words of Count Beust, "not a Prussian
  humiliation, but an Austrian weakness." It was in the power of Austria to
  crush Prussia and to put an end to the dual influence in the
  Confederation which experience had proved to be unworkable; she preferred
  to re-establish a discredited system, and to leave to Prussia time and
  opportunity to gather strength for the inevitable conflict.</p>

  <p>In 1851 Austria had apparently triumphed over all its <span
  class="sidenote">Triumph of Austria.</span> <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>[v.03 p.0017]</span>difficulties.
  The revolutionary movements had been suppressed, the attempt of Prussia
  to assume the leadership in Germany defeated, the old Federal Diet of
  1815 had been restored. Vienna again became the centre of a despotic
  government the objects of which were to Germanize the Magyars and Slavs,
  to check all agitation for a constitution, and to suppress all attempts
  to secure a free press. For some ten years the Austrian dominion groaned
  under one of the worst possible forms of autocratic government. The
  failure of the Habsburg emperor to perpetuate this despotic régime was
  due (1) to the Crimean War, (2) to the establishment of Italian unity,
  and (3) to the successful assertion by Prussia of its claim to the
  leadership in Germany. The disputes which resulted in the Crimean War
  revealed the fact that "gratitude" plays but a small part in
  international affairs. In the minds of Austrian statesmen the question of
  the free navigation of the Danube, which would have been imperilled by a
  Russian occupation of the Principalities, outweighed their sense of
  obligation to Russia, on which the emperor Nicholas had rashly relied.
  That Austria at first took no active part in the war was due, not to any
  sentimental weakness, but to the refusal of Prussia to go along with her
  and to the fear of a Sardinian attack on her Italian provinces. But, on
  the withdrawal of the Russian forces from the Principalities, these were
  occupied by Austrian troops, and on the 2nd of December 1854, a treaty of
  alliance was signed at Vienna, between Great Britain, Austria and France,
  by which Austria undertook to occupy Moldavia and Walachia during the
  continuance of the war and "to defend the frontier of the said
  principalities against any return of the Russian forces." By Article
  III., in the event of war between Russia and Austria the alliance both
  offensive and defensive was to be made effective (Hertslet, No. 252).
  With the progressive disasters of the Russian arms, however, Austria grew
  bolder, and it was the ultimatum delivered by her to the emperor
  Alexander II. in December 1855, that forced Russia to come to terms
  (Treaty of Paris, March 30, 1856).</p>

  <p>Though, however, Austria by her diplomatic attitude had secured,
  without striking a blow, the settlement in her sense of the Eastern
  Question, she emerged from the contest without allies and without
  friends. The "Holy Alliance" of the three autocratic northern powers,
  recemented at Münchengrätz in 1833, which had gained for Austria the
  decisive intervention of the tsar in 1849, had been hopelessly shattered
  by her attitude during the Crimean War. Russia, justly offended, drew
  closer her ties with Prussia, where Bismarck was already hatching the
  plans which were to mature in 1866; and, if the attitude of Napoleon in
  the Polish question prevented any revival of the alliance of Tilsit, the
  goodwill of Russia was assured for France in the coming struggle with
  Austria in Italy. Already the isolation of Austria had been conspicuous
  in the congress of Paris, where Cavour, the Sardinian plenipotentiary,
  laid bare before assembled Europe the scandal of her rule in Italy. It
  was emphasized during the campaign of 1859, when Sardinia, in alliance
  with France, laid the foundations of united Italy. The threat of Prussian
  intervention, which determined the provisions of the armistice of
  Villafranca, was due, not to love of Austria, but to fear of the undue
  aggrandizement of France. The campaign of 1859, and the diplomatic events
  that led up to it, are dealt with elsewhere (see <span
  class="sc">Italy</span>, <span class="sc">Italian Wars</span>, <span
  class="sc">Napoleon III.</span>, <span class="sc">Cavour</span>). The
  results to Austria were two-fold. Externally, she lost all her Italian
  possessions except Venice; internally, her failure led to the necessity
  of conciliating public opinion by constitutional concessions.</p>

  <p>The proclamation on the 26th of February 1861 of the new constitution
  for the whole monarchy, elaborated by Anton von Schmerling, though far
  from satisfying the national aspirations of the races within the empire,
  at least gave Austria a temporary popularity in Germany; the liberalism
  of the Habsburg monarchy was favourably contrasted with the "reactionary"
  policy of Prussia, where Bismarck was defying the majority of the diet in
  his determination to build up the military power of Prussia. The meeting
  of the princes summoned to Frankfort by the emperor Francis Joseph, in
  1863, revealed the ascendancy of Austria among the smaller states of the
  Confederation; but it revealed also the impossibility of any
  consolidation of the Confederation without the co-operation of Prussia,
  which stood outside. Bismarck had long since decided that the matter
  could only be settled by the exclusion of Austria altogether, and that
  the means to this end were not discussion, but "Blood and Iron." The
  issue was forced by the developments of the tangled Schleswig-Holstein
  Question (<i>q.v.</i>), which led to the definitive breach between the
  two great German powers, to the campaign of 1866, and the collapse of
  Austria on the field of Koniggratz (July 3. See <span class="sc">Seven
  Weeks' War</span>).</p>

  <p>(W. A. P.; <span class="sc">A. Hl.</span>)</p>

  <p>The war of 1866 began a new era in the history of the Austrian empire.
  By the treaty of Prague (August 23, 1866) the emperor surrendered the
  position in Germany which his ancestors had held for so many centuries;
  Austria and Tirol, Bohemia and Salzburg, ceased to be German, and eight
  million Germans were cut off from all political union with their
  fellow-countrymen. At the <span class="sidenote">Establishment of the
  dual monarchy.</span> same time the surrender of Venetia completed the
  work of 1859, and the last remnant of the old-established Habsburg
  domination in Italy ceased. The war was immediately followed by a
  reorganization of the government. The Magyar nation, as well as the
  Czechs, had refused to recognize the validity of the constitution of 1861
  which had established a common parliament for the whole empire; they
  demanded that the independence of the kingdom of Hungary should be
  restored. Even before the war the necessity of coming to terms with the
  Hungarians had been recognized. In June 1865 the emperor Francis Joseph
  visited Pest and replaced the chancellors of Transylvania and Hungary,
  Counts Francis Zichy and Nadásdy, supporters of the February
  constitution, by Count Majláth, a leader of the old conservative
  magnates. This was at once followed by the resignation of Schmerling, who
  was succeeded by Count Richard Belcredi. On the 20th of September the
  Reichsrath was prorogued, which was equivalent to the suspension of the
  constitution; and in December the emperor opened the Hungarian diet in
  person, with a speech from the throne that recognized the validity of the
  laws of 1848. Before any definite arrangement as to their re-introduction
  could be made, however, the war broke out; and after the defeats on the
  field of battle the Hungarian diet was able to make its own terms. They
  recognized no union between their country and the other parts of the
  monarchy except that which was based on the Pragmatic Sanction.<a
  name="FnAnchor_025" href="#Footnote_025"><sup>[5]</sup></a> All recent
  innovations, all attempts made during the last hundred years to absorb
  Hungary in a greater Austria, were revoked. An agreement was made by
  which the emperor was to be crowned at Pest and take the ancient oath to
  the Golden Bull; Hungary (including Transylvania and Croatia) was to have
  its own parliament and its own ministry; Magyar was to be the official
  language; the emperor was to rule as king; there was to be complete
  separation of the finances; not even a common nationality was recognized
  between the Hungarians and the other subjects of the emperor; a Hungarian
  was to be a foreigner in Vienna, an Austrian a foreigner in Budapest. A
  large party wished indeed that nothing should be left but a purely
  personal union similar to that between England and Hanover. Deák and the
  majority agreed, however, that there should be certain institutions
  common to Hungary and the rest of the monarchy; these were&mdash;(1)
  foreign affairs, including the diplomatic and consular service; (2) the
  army and navy; (3) the control of the expenses required for these
  branches of the public service.</p>

  <p>Recognizing in a declaratory act the legal existence of these common
  institutions, they also determined the method by which they should be
  administered. In doing so they carried out with great exactitude the
  principle of dualism, establishing in form a complete parity between
  Hungary on one side and the other territories of the king on the other.
  They made it a condition <span class="sidenote">Delegations.</span> <!--
  Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[v.03
  p.0018]</span>that there should be constitutional government in the rest
  of the monarchy as well as in Hungary, and a parliament in which all the
  other territories should be represented. From both the Hungarian and the
  Austrian parliament there was to be elected a <i>Delegation</i>,
  consisting of sixty members; to these Delegations the common ministers
  were to be responsible, and to them the estimates for the joint services
  were to be submitted. The annual meetings were to be held alternately in
  Vienna and in Pest. They were very careful that these Delegations should
  not overshadow the parliaments by which they were appointed. The
  Delegations were not to sit together; each was to meet separately; they
  were to communicate by writing, every document being accompanied by a
  translation in Magyar or German, as the case might be; only if after
  three times exchanging notes they failed to agree was there to be a
  common session; in that case there would be no discussion, and they were
  to vote in silence; a simple majority was sufficient. There were to be
  three ministers for common purposes&mdash;(1) for foreign affairs; (2)
  for war; (3) for finance; these ministers were responsible to the
  Delegations, but the Delegations were really given no legislative power.
  The minister of war controlled the common army, but even the laws
  determining the method by which the army was to be recruited had to be
  voted separately in each of the parliaments. The minister of finance had
  to lay before them the common budget, but they could not raise money or
  vote taxes; after they had passed the budget the money required had to be
  provided by the separate parliaments. Even the determination of the
  proportion which each half of the monarchy was to contribute was not left
  to the Delegations. It was to be fixed once every ten years by separate
  committees chosen for that purpose from the Austrian Reichsrath and the
  Hungarian parliament, the so-called <i>Quota-Deputations</i>. In addition
  to these "common affairs" the Hungarians, indeed, recognized that there
  were certain other matters which it was desirable should be managed on
  identical principles in the two halves of the monarchy&mdash;namely,
  customs and excise currency; the army and common railways. For these,
  however, no common institutions were created; they must be arranged by
  agreement; the ministers must confer and then introduce identical acts in
  the Hungarian and the Austrian parliaments.</p>

  <p>The main principles of this agreement were decided during <span
  class="sidenote">Financial settlement.</span> the spring of 1867; but
  during this period the Austrians were not really consulted at all. The
  negotiations on behalf of the court of Vienna were entrusted to Beust,
  whom the emperor appointed chancellor of the empire and also
  minister-president of Austria. He had no previous experience of Austrian
  affairs, and was only anxious at once to bring about a settlement which
  would enable the empire to take a strong position in international
  politics. In the summer of 1867, however (the Austrian Reichsrath having
  met), the two parliaments each elected a deputation of fifteen members to
  arrange the financial settlement. The first matter was the debt,
  amounting to over 3000 million gulden, in addition to the floating debt,
  which had been contracted during recent years. The Hungarians laid down
  the principle that they were in no way responsible for debts contracted
  during a time when they had been deprived of their constitutional
  liberties; they consented, however, to pay each year 29½ million gulden
  towards the interest. The whole responsibility for the payment of the
  remainder of the interest, amounting annually to over a hundred million
  gulden, and the management of the debt, was left to the Austrians. The
  Hungarians wished that a considerable part of it should be repudiated. It
  was then agreed that the two states should form a Customs Union for the
  next ten years; the customs were to be paid to the common exchequer; all
  sums required in addition to this to meet the expenses were to be
  provided as to 30% by Hungary and as to 70% by Austria. After the
  financial question had been thus settled, the whole of these arrangements
  were then, on the 21st and the 24th of December 1867, enacted by the two
  parliaments, and the system of dualism was established.</p>

  <p>The acts were accepted in Austria out of necessity; but no parties
  were really satisfied. The Germans, who accepted the principle of
  dualism, were indignant at the financial arrangements; for Hungary, while
  gaining more than an equal share of power, paid less than one-third of
  the common expenses. On the other hand, according to British ideas of
  taxable capacity, Hungary paid, and still pays, more than her share. The
  Germans, however, could at least hope that in the future the financial
  arrangements might be revised; the complaints of the Slav races were
  political, and within the constitution there was no means of remedy, for,
  while the settlement gave to the Hungarians all that they demanded, it
  deprived the Bohemians or Galicians of any hope that they would be able
  to obtain similar independence. Politically, the principle underlying the
  agreement was that the empire should be divided into two portions; in one
  of these the Magyars were to rule, in the other the Germans; in either
  section the Slav races&mdash;the Serbs and Croatians, the Czechs, Poles
  and Slovenes&mdash;were to be placed in a position of political
  inferiority.<a name="FnAnchor_026"
  href="#Footnote_026"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The logical consistency with which the principle of Dualism was
  carried out is shown in a change of title. By a letter to Beust of the
  14th of November 1868 the emperor ordered that he should henceforward be
  styled, not as before "Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, King of
  Bohemia, &amp;c.," but "Emperor of Austria, King of Bohemia, &amp;c., and
  Apostolic King of Hungary," thereby signifying the separation of the two
  districts over which he rules. His shorter style is "His Majesty the
  Emperor and King," and "His Imperial and Apostolic Royal Majesty"; the
  lands over which he rules are called "The Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy" or
  "The Austrian-Hungarian Realm." The new terminology, "Imperial and Royal"
  (<i>Kaiserlich und Königlich</i>), has since then been applied to all
  those branches of the public service which belong to the common
  ministries; this was first the case with the diplomatic service; not till
  1889 was it applied to the army, which for some time kept up the old
  style of <i>Kaiserlich-Königlich</i>; in 1895 it was applied to the
  ministry of the imperial house, an office always held by the minister for
  foreign affairs. The minister for foreign affairs was at first called the
  <i>Reichskanzler</i>; but in 1871, when Andrássy succeeded Beust, this
  was given up in deference to Hungarian feeling, for it might be taken to
  imply that there was a single state of which he was minister. The old
  style <i>Kaiserlich-Königlich</i>, the "K.K." which has become so
  familiar through long use, is still retained in the Austrian half of the
  monarchy. There are, therefore, <i>e.g.</i>, three ministries of finance:
  the <i>Kaiserlich und Königlich</i> for joint affairs; the
  <i>Kaiserlich-Königlich</i> for Austrian affairs; the <i>Királyé</i> for
  Hungary.</p>

  <p>The settlement with Hungary consisted then of three parts:&mdash;(1)
  <span class="sidenote">Common affairs.</span> the political settlement,
  which was to be permanent and has since remained part of the fundamental
  constitution of the monarchy; (2) the periodical financial settlement,
  determining the partition of the common expenses as arranged by the
  Quota-Deputations and ratified by the parliaments; (3) the Customs Union
  and the agreement as to currency&mdash;a voluntary and terminable
  arrangement made between the two governments and parliaments. The history
  of the common affairs which fall under the management of the common
  ministries is, then, the history of the foreign policy of the empire and
  of the army. It is with this and this alone that the Delegations are
  occupied, and it is to this that we must now turn. The annual meetings
  call for little notice; they have generally been the occasion on which
  the foreign minister has explained and justified his policy; according to
  the English custom, red books, sometimes containing important despatches,
  have been laid before them; but the debates have caused less
  embarrassment to the government than is generally the case in
  parliamentary assemblies, and the army budget has generally been passed
  with few and unimportant alterations.</p>

  <p>For the first four years, while Beust was chancellor, the <span
  class="sidenote">Foreign policy.</span> foreign policy was still
  influenced by the feelings left by the war of 1866. We do not know how
  far there was a real intention to revenge Königgrätz and recover the
  position lost in Germany. This would be at least a possible policy, and
  one to which Beust by his previous history would be inclined. There were
  sharp passages of arms with the <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>[v.03 p.0019]</span>Prussian government regarding the
  position of the South German states; a close friendship was maintained
  with France; there were meetings of the emperor and of Napoleon at
  Salzburg in 1868, and the next year at Paris; the death of Maximilian in
  Mexico cast a shadow over the friendship, but did not destroy it. The
  opposition of the Hungarians and financial difficulties probably
  prevented a warlike policy. In 1870 there were discussions preparatory to
  a formal alliance with France against the North German Confederation, but
  nothing was signed.<a name="FnAnchor_027"
  href="#Footnote_027"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The war of 1870 put an end to all
  ideas of this kind; the German successes were so rapid that Austria was
  not exposed to the temptation of intervening, a temptation that could
  hardly have been resisted had the result been doubtful or the struggle
  prolonged. The absorption of South Germany in the German empire took away
  the chief cause for friction; and from that time warm friendship, based
  on the maintenance of the established order, has existed between the two
  empires. Austria gave up all hope of regaining her position in Germany;
  Germany disclaimed all intention of acquiring the German provinces of
  Austria. Beust's retirement in 1871 put the finishing touch on the new
  relations. His successor, Count Andrássy, a Hungarian, established a good
  understanding with Bismarck; and in 1872 the visit of the emperor Francis
  Joseph, accompanied by his minister, to Berlin, was the final sign of the
  reconciliation with his uncle. The tsar was also present on that
  occasion, and for the next six years the close friendship between the
  three empires removed all danger of war. Three years later the full
  reconciliation with Italy followed, when Francis Joseph consented to
  visit Victor Emmanuel in Venice.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of disturbance in the Balkans ended this period <span
  class="sidenote">The Eastern question.</span> of calm. The insurrection
  in Bosnia and Herzegovina immediately affected Austria; refugees in large
  numbers crossed the frontier and had to be maintained by the government.
  The political problem presented was a very difficult one. The sympathy of
  the Slav inhabitants of the empire made it impossible for the government
  of Vienna to regard with indifference the sufferings of Christians in
  Turkey. Active support was impossible, because the Hungarians, among whom
  the events of 1848 had obliterated the remembrance of the earlier days of
  Turkish conquest, were full of sympathy for the Turks. It was a cardinal
  principle of Austrian policy that she could not allow the erection of new
  Slav states on her southern frontier. Moreover, the disturbances were
  fomented by Russian agents, and any increase of Russian influence (for
  which the Pan-Slav party was working) was full of danger to Austria. For
  a time the mediation of Germany preserved the good understanding between
  the two eastern empires. In 1875 Andrássy drafted a note, which was
  accepted by the powers, requiring Turkey to institute the reforms
  necessary for the good government of the provinces. Turkey agreed to do
  this, but the insurgents required a guarantee from the Powers that Turkey
  would keep her engagements. This could not be given, and the rebellion
  continued and spread to Bulgaria. The lead then passed to Russia, and
  Austria, even after the outbreak of war, did not oppose Russian measures.
  At the beginning of 1877 a secret understanding had been made between the
  two powers, by which Russia undertook not to annex any territory, and in
  other ways not to take steps which would be injurious to Austria. The
  advance of the Russian army on Constantinople, however, was a serious
  menace to Austrian influence; Andrássy therefore demanded that the terms
  of peace should be submitted to a European conference, which he suggested
  should meet at Vienna. The peace of San Stefano violated the engagements
  made by Russia, and Andrássy was therefore compelled to ask for a credit
  of 60 million gulden and to mobilize a small portion of the army; the
  money was granted unanimously in the Hungarian Delegation, though the
  Magyars disliked a policy the object of which appeared to be not the
  defence of Turkey against Russia, but an agreement with Russia which
  would give Austria compensation at the expense of Turkey; in the Austrian
  Deputation it was voted only by a majority of 39 to 20, for the Germans
  were alarmed at the report that it would be used for an occupation of
  part of the Turkish territory.</p>

  <p>The active share taken by Great Britain, however, relieved <span
  class="sidenote">Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span> Austria from the
  necessity of having recourse to further measures. By an arrangement made
  beforehand, Austria was requested at the congress of Berlin to undertake
  the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina&mdash;an
  honourable but arduous task. The provinces could not be left to the
  Turks; Austria could not allow them to fall under Russian influence. The
  occupation was immediately begun, and 60,000 Austrian troops, under the
  command of General Philippovich,<a name="FnAnchor_028"
  href="#Footnote_028"><sup>[8]</sup></a> crossed the frontier on the 29th
  of July. The work was, however, more difficult than had been anticipated;
  the Mahommedans offered a strenuous resistance; military operations were
  attended with great difficulty in the mountainous country; 200,000 men
  were required, and they did not succeed in crushing the resistance till
  after some months of obstinate fighting. The losses on either side were
  very heavy; even after the capture of Serajevo in August, the resistance
  was continued; and besides those who fell in battle, a considerable
  number of the insurgents were put to death under military law. The
  opposition in the Delegations, which met at the end of the year, was so
  strong that the government had to be content with a credit to cover the
  expenses for 1879 of less than half what they had originally asked, and
  the supplementary estimate of 40,000,000 gulden for 1878 was not voted
  till the next year. In 1879 the Porte, after long delay, recognized the
  occupation on the distinct understanding that the sovereignty of the
  sultan was acknowledged. A civil administration was then established, the
  provinces not being attached to either half of the empire, but placed
  under the control of the joint minister of finance. The government during
  the first two years was not very successful; the Christian population
  were disappointed at finding that they still had, as in the old days, to
  pay rent to the Mahommedan begs. There were difficulties also between the
  Roman Catholics and the members of the Greek Church. In 1881 disturbances
  in Dalmatia spread over the frontier into Herzegovina, and another
  expedition had to be sent to restore order. When this was done Benjamin
  de Kallay was appointed minister, and under his judicious government
  order and prosperity were established in the provinces. In accordance
  with another clause of the treaty of Berlin, Austria was permitted to
  place troops in the sanjak of Novi-Bazar, a district of great strategic
  importance, which separated Servia and Montenegro, and through which the
  communication between Bosnia and Salonica passed. This was done in
  September 1879, an agreement with Turkey having specified the numbers and
  position of the garrison. Another slight alteration of the frontier was
  made in the same year, when, during the delimitation of the new frontier
  of Montenegro, the district of Spizza was incorporated in the kingdom of
  Dalmatia.</p>

  <p>The congress of Berlin indirectly caused some difficulties with <span
  class="sidenote">Italy and the Irredentists.</span> Italy. In that
  country was a large party which, under the name of the "Irredentists,"
  demanded that those Italian-speaking districts, South Tirol, Istria and
  Trieste, which were under Austrian rule, should be joined to Italy; there
  were public meetings and riots in Italy; the Austrian flag was torn down
  from the consulate in Venice and the embassy at Rome insulted. The
  excitement spread across the frontier; there were riots in Trieste, and
  in Tirol it was necessary to make some slight movement of troops as a
  sign that the Austrian government was determined not to surrender any
  territory. For a short time there was apprehension that the Italian
  government might not be strong enough to resist the movement, and might
  even attempt to realize these wishes by means of an alliance with Russia;
  but the danger quickly passed away.</p>

  <p>In the year 1879 the European position of the monarchy was <span
  class="sidenote">Alliance with Germany.</span> <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[v.03 p.0020]</span>placed on a more
  secure footing by the conclusion of a formal alliance with Germany. In
  the autumn of that year Bismarck visited Vienna and arranged with
  Andrássy a treaty by which Germany bound herself to support Austria
  against an attack from Russia, Austria-Hungary pledging herself to help
  Germany against a combined attack of France and Russia; the result of
  this treaty, of which the tsar was informed, was to remove, at least for
  the time, the danger of war between Austria-Hungary and Russia. It was
  the last achievement of Andrássy, who had already resigned, but it was
  maintained by his successor, Baron Haymerle, and after his death in 1881
  by Count Kalnóky. It was strengthened in 1882 by the adhesion of Italy,
  for after 1881 the Italians required support, owing to the French
  occupation of Tunis, and after five years it was renewed. Since that time
  it has been the foundation on which the policy of Austria-Hungary has
  depended, and it has survived all dangers arising either from commercial
  differences (as between 1880 and 1890) or national discord. The alliance
  was naturally very popular among the German Austrians; some of them went
  so far as to attempt to use it to influence internal policy, and
  suggested that fidelity to this alliance required that there should be a
  ministry at Vienna which supported the Germans in their internal struggle
  with the Slavs; they represented it as a national alliance of the
  Teutonic races, and there were some Germans in the empire who supported
  them in this view. The governments on both sides could of course give no
  countenance to this theory; Bismarck especially was very careful never to
  let it be supposed that he desired to exercise influence over the
  internal affairs of his ally. Had he done so, the strong anti-German
  passions of the Czechs and Poles, always inclined to an alliance with
  France, would have been aroused, and no government could have maintained
  the alliance. After 1880, the exertions of Count Kalnóky again
  established a fairly good understanding with Russia, as was shown by the
  meetings of Francis Joseph with the tsar in 1884 and 1885, but the
  outbreak of the Bulgarian question in 1885 again brought into prominence
  the opposed interests of Russia and Austria-Hungary. In the December of
  this year Austria-Hungary indeed decisively interfered in the war between
  Bulgaria and Servia, for at this time Austrian influence predominated in
  Servia, and after the battle of Slivnitza the Austro-Hungarian minister
  warned Prince Alexander of Bulgaria that if he advanced farther he would
  be met by Austro-Hungarian as well as Servian troops. But after the
  abdication of Alexander, Count Kalnóky stated in the Delegations that
  Austria-Hungary would not permit Russia to interfere with the
  independence of Bulgaria. This decided step was required by Hungarian
  feeling, but it was a policy in which Austria-Hungary could not depend on
  the support of Germany, for&mdash;as Bismarck stated&mdash;Bulgaria was
  not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier. Austria-Hungary
  also differed from Russia as to the position of Prince Ferdinand of
  Bulgaria, and during 1886-1887 much alarm was caused by the massing of
  Russian troops on the Galician frontier. Councils of war were summoned to
  consider how this exposed and distant province was to be defended, and
  for some months war was considered inevitable; but the danger was averted
  by the renewal of the Triple Alliance and the other decisive steps taken
  at this time by the German government (see <span
  class="sc">Germany</span>).<a name="FnAnchor_029"
  href="#Footnote_029"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Since this time the foreign policy of Austria-Hungary has been
  peaceful and unambitious; the close connexion with Germany has so far
  been maintained, though during the last few years it has been
  increasingly difficult to prevent the violent passions engendered by
  national enmity at home from reacting on the foreign policy of the
  monarchy; it would scarcely be possible to do so, were it not that
  discussions on foreign policy take place not in the parliaments but in
  the Delegations where the numbers are fewer and the passions cooler. In
  May 1895 Count Kalnóky had to retire, owing to a difference with Bánffy,
  the Hungarian premier, arising out of the struggle with Rome. He was
  succeeded by Count Goluchowski, the son of a well-known Polish statesman.
  In 1898 the expulsion of Austrian subjects from Prussia, in connexion
  with the Anti-Polish policy of the Prussian government, caused a passing
  irritation, to which Count Thun, the Austrian premier, gave expression.
  The chief objects of the government in recent years have been to maintain
  Austro-Hungarian trade and influence in the Balkan states by the building
  of railways, by the opening of the Danube for navigation, and by
  commercial treaties with Rumania, Servia and Bulgaria; since the
  abdication of King Milan especially, the affairs of Servia and the growth
  of Russian influence in that country have caused serious anxiety.</p>

  <p>The disturbed state of European politics and the great increase <span
  class="sidenote">The army.</span> in the military establishments of other
  countries made it desirable for Austria also to strengthen her military
  resources. The bad condition of the finances rendered it, however,
  impossible to carry out any very great measures. In 1868 there had been
  introduced compulsory military service in both Austria and Hungary; the
  total of the army available in war had been fixed at 800,000 men. Besides
  this joint army placed under the joint ministry of war, there was in each
  part of the monarchy a separate militia and a separate minister for
  national defence. In Hungary this national force or <i>honvéd</i> was
  kept quite distinct from the ordinary army; in Austria, however (except
  in Dalmatia and Tirol, where there was a separate local militia), the
  <i>Landwehr</i>, as it was called, was practically organized as part of
  the standing army. At the renewal of the periodical financial and
  economic settlement (<i>Ausgleich</i>) in 1877 no important change was
  made, but in 1882 the system of compulsory service was extended to Bosnia
  and Herzegovina, and a reorganization was carried out, including the
  introduction of army corps and local organization on the Prussian plan.
  This was useful for the purposes of speedy mobilization, though there was
  some danger that the local and national spirit might penetrate into the
  army. In 1886 a law was carried in either parliament creating a
  <i>Landsturm</i>, and providing for the arming and organization of the
  whole male population up to the age of forty-two in case of emergency,
  and in 1889 a small increase was made in the annual number of recruits. A
  further increase was made in 1892-1893. In contrast, however, with the
  military history of other continental powers, that of Austria-Hungary
  shows a small increase in the army establishment. Of recent years there
  have been signs of an attempt to tamper with the use of German as the
  common language for the whole army. This, which is now the principal
  remnant of the old ascendancy of German, and the one point of unity for
  the whole monarchy, is a matter on which the government and the monarch
  allow no concession, but in the Hungarian parliament protests against it
  have been raised, and in 1899 and 1900 it was necessary to punish
  recruits from Bohemia, who answered the roll call in the Czechish
  <i>zde</i> instead of the German <i>hier</i>.</p>

  <p>In those matters which belong to the periodical and terminable <span
  class="sidenote">The Customs Union.</span> agreement, the most important
  is the Customs Union, which was established in 1867, and it is convenient
  to treat separately the commercial policy of the dual state.<a
  name="FnAnchor_0210" href="#Footnote_0210"><sup>[10]</sup></a> At first
  the customs tariff in Austria-Hungary, as in most other countries, was
  based on a number of commercial treaties with Germany, France, Italy,
  Great Britain, &amp;c., each of which specified the maximum duties that
  could be levied on certain articles, and all of which contained a "most
  favoured nation" clause. The practical result was a system very nearly
  approaching to the absence of any customs duties, and for the period for
  which these treaties lasted a revision of the tariff could not be carried
  out by means of legislation. After the year 1873, a strong movement in
  favour of protective duties made itself felt among the Austrian
  manufacturers who were affected by the competition of German, English and
  Belgian goods, and Austria was influenced by the general movement in
  economic thought which about this time caused the reaction <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[v.03 p.0021]</span>against
  the doctrines of free trade. Hungary, on the other hand, was still in
  favour of free trade, for there were no important manufacturing
  industries in that country, and it required a secure market for
  agricultural produce. After 1875 the commercial treaties expired; Hungary
  thereupon also gave notice to terminate the commercial union with
  Austria, and negotiations began as to the principle on which it was to be
  renewed. This was done during the year 1877, and in the new treaty, while
  raw material was still imported free of duty, a low duty was placed on
  textile goods as well as on corn, and the excise on sugar and brandy was
  raised. All duties, moreover, were to be paid in gold&mdash;this at once
  involving a considerable increase. The tariff treaties with Great Britain
  and France were not renewed, and all attempts to come to some agreement
  with Germany broke down, owing to the change of policy which Bismarck was
  adopting at this period. The result was that the system of commercial
  treaties ceased, and Austria-Hungary was free to introduce a fresh tariff
  depending simply on legislation, an "autonomous tariff" as it is called.
  With Great Britain, France and Germany, there was now only a "most
  favoured nation" agreement; fresh commercial treaties were made with
  Italy (1879), Switzerland and Servia (1881). During 1881-1882 Hungary,
  desiring means of retaliation against the duties on corn and the
  impediments to the importation of cattle recently introduced into
  Germany, withdrew her opposition to protective duties; the tariff was
  completely revised, protective duties were introduced on all articles of
  home production, and high finance duties on other articles such as coffee
  and petroleum. At the same time special privileges were granted to
  articles imported by sea, so as to foster the trade of Trieste and Fiume;
  as in Germany a subvention was granted to the great shipping companies,
  the Austrian Lloyd and Adria; the area of the Customs Union was enlarged
  so as to include Trieste, Istria and Dalmatia, as well as Bosnia and
  Herzegovina. In 1887 a further increase of duties was laid on corn (this
  was at the desire of Hungary as against Rumania, for a vigorous customs
  war was being carried on at this time) and on woollen and textile goods.
  Austria, therefore, during these years completely gave up the principle
  of free trade, and adopted a nationalist policy similar to that which
  prevailed in Germany. A peculiar feature of these treaties was that the
  government was empowered to impose an additional duty
  (<i>Retorsionszoll</i>) on goods imported from countries in which
  Austria-Hungary received unfavourable treatment. In 1881 this was fixed
  at 10% (5% for some articles), but in 1887 it was raised to 30 and 15%
  respectively. In 1892 Austria-Hungary joined with Germany, Italy,
  Belgium, and Switzerland in commercial treaties to last for twelve years,
  the object being to secure to the states of central Europe a stable and
  extended market; for the introduction of high tariffs in Russia and
  America had crippled industry. Two years later Austria-Hungary also
  arranged with Russia a treaty similar to that already made between Russia
  and Germany; the reductions in the tariff secured in these treaties were
  applicable also to Great Britain, with which there still was a most
  favoured nation treaty. The system thus introduced gave commercial
  security till the year 1903.</p>

  <p>The result of these and other laws was an improvement in financial
  <span class="sidenote">Reform of the Currency.</span> conditions, which
  enabled the government at last to take in hand the long-delayed task of
  reforming the currency. Hitherto the currency had been partly in silver
  (gulden), the "Austrian currency" which had been introduced in 1857,
  partly in paper money, which took the form of notes issued by the
  Austro-Hungarian Bank. This institution had, in 1867, belonged entirely
  to Austria; it had branches in Hungary, and its notes were current
  throughout the monarchy, but the direction was entirely Austrian. The
  Hungarians had not sufficient credit to establish a national bank of
  their own, and at the settlement of 1877 they procured, as a concession
  to themselves, that it should be converted into an Austro-Hungarian bank,
  with a head office at Pest as well as at Vienna, and with the management
  divided between the two countries. This arrangement was renewed in 1887.
  In 1848 the government had been obliged to authorize the bank to suspend
  cash payments, and the wars of 1859 and 1866 had rendered abortive all
  attempts to renew them. The notes, therefore, formed an inconvertible
  paper currency. The bank by its charter had the sole right of issuing
  notes, but during the war of 1866 the government, in order to raise
  money, had itself issued notes (<i>Staatsnoten</i>) to the value of 312
  million gulden, thereby violating the charter of the bank. The operation
  begun in 1892 was therefore threefold: (1) the substitution of a gold for
  a silver standard; (2) the redemption of the <i>Staatsnoten</i>; (3) the
  resumption of cash payments by the bank.</p>

  <p>In 1867 Austria-Hungary had taken part in the monetary conference
  which led to the formation of the Latin Union; it was intended to join
  the Union, but this was not done. A first step, however, had been taken
  in this direction by the issue of gold coins of the value of eight and
  four gulden. No attempt was made, however, to regulate the relations of
  these coins to the "Austrian" silver coinage; the two issues were not
  brought into connexion, and every payment was made in silver, unless it
  was definitely agreed that it should be paid in gold. In 1879, owing to
  the continued depreciation of silver, the free coinage of silver was
  suspended. In 1892 laws introducing a completely new coinage were carried
  in both parliaments, in accordance with agreements made by the ministers.
  The unit in the new issue was to be the krone, divided into 100 heller;
  the krone being almost of the same value (24-25th) as the franc. (The
  twenty-krone piece in gold weighs 6.775 gr., the twenty-franc piece
  6.453.) The gold krone was equal to .42 of the gold gulden, and it was
  declared equal to .5 of the silver gulden, so much allowance being made
  for the depreciation of silver. The first step towards putting this act
  into practice was the issue of one-krone pieces (silver), which
  circulated as half gulden, and of nickel coins; all the copper coins and
  other silver coins were recalled, the silver gulden alone being left in
  circulation. The coinage of the gold four- and eight-gulden was
  suspended. Nothing more could be done till the supply of gold had been
  increased. The bank was required to buy gold (during 1892 it bought over
  forty M. gulden), and was obliged to coin into twenty- or ten-krone
  pieces all gold brought to it for that purpose. Then a loan of 150 M.
  gulden at 4% was made, and from the gold (chiefly bar gold and
  sovereigns) which Rothschild, who undertook the loan, paid in, coins of
  the new issue were struck to the value of over 34 million kronen. This
  was, however, not put into circulation; it was used first for paying off
  the <i>Staatsnoten</i>. By 1894 the state was able to redeem them to the
  amount of 200 million gulden, including all those for one gulden. It paid
  them, however, not in gold, but in silver (one-krone pieces and gulden)
  and in bank notes, the coins and notes being provided by the bank, and in
  exchange the newly-coined gold was paid to the bank to be kept as a
  reserve to cover the issue of notes. At the same time arrangements were
  made between Austria and Hungary to pay off about 80 million of exchequer
  bills which had been issued on the security of the government salt-works,
  and were therefore called "<i>salinenscheine.</i>" In 1899 the remainder
  of the <i>Staatsnoten</i> (112 million gulden) were redeemed in a similar
  manner. The bank had in this way acquired a large reserve of gold, and in
  the new charter which was (after long delay) passed in 1899, a clause was
  introduced requiring the resumption of cash payments, though this was not
  to come into operation immediately. Then from 1st January 1900 the old
  reckoning by gulden was superseded, that by krone being introduced in all
  government accounts, the new silver being made a legal tender only for a
  limited amount. For the time until the 1st of July 1908, however, the old
  gulden were left in circulation, payments made in them, at the rate of
  two kronen to one gulden, being legal up to any amount.</p>

  <p>This important reform has thereby been brought to a satisfactory
  conclusion, and at a time when the political difficulties had reached a
  most acute stage. It is indeed remarkable that notwithstanding the
  complicated machinery of the dual monarchy, and the numerous obstacles
  which have to be overcome before a reform affecting both countries can be
  carried out, the financial, the commercial, and the foreign policy has
  been conducted since 1870 with success. The credit of the state has
  risen, the chronic deficit has disappeared, the currency has been put on
  a sound basis, and part of the unfunded debt has been paid off. Universal
  military service has been introduced, and all this has been done in the
  presence of difficulties greater than existed in any other civilized
  country.</p>

  <p>Each of the financial and economic reforms described above <span
  class="sidenote">The Ausgleich with Hungary.</span> was, of course, the
  subject of a separate law, but, so far as they are determined at the
  general settlement which takes place between Austria and Hungary every
  ten years, they are comprised under the expression "Ausgleich" (compact
  or compromise), which includes especially the determination of the Quota,
  and to this extent they are all dealt with together as part of a general
  settlement and bargain. In this settlement a concession on commercial
  policy would be set off against a gain on the financial agreement;
  <i>e.g.</i> in 1877 Austria gave Hungary a share in the management of the
  bank, while the arrangement for paying the bonus on exported sugar was
  favourable to Austria; on the other hand, since the increased duty on
  coffee and petroleum would fall more heavily on Austria, the Austrians
  wished to persuade the Hungarians to pay a larger quota of the common
  expenses, and there was also a dispute whether Hungary was partly
  responsible for a debt of 80 M. <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>[v.03 p.0022]</span>gulden to the bank. Each measure
  had, therefore, to be considered not only on its own merits, but in
  relation to the general balance of advantage, and an amendment in one
  might bring about the rejection of all. The whole series of acts had to
  be carried in two parliaments, each open to the influence of national
  jealousy and race hatred in its most extreme form, so that the
  negotiations have been conducted under serious difficulties, and the
  periodical settlement has always been a time of great anxiety. The first
  settlement occupied two full years, from 1876, when the negotiations
  began, to June 1878, when at last all the bills were carried successfully
  through the two parliaments; and it was necessary to prolong the previous
  arrangements (which expired at the end of 1877) till the middle of 1878.
  First the two ministries had to agree on the drafts of all the bills;
  then the bills had to be laid before the two parliaments. Each parliament
  elected a committee to consider them, and the two committees carried on
  long negotiations by notes supplemented by verbal discussions. Then
  followed the debates in the two parliaments; there was a ministerial
  crisis in Austria, because the House refused to accept the tax on coffee
  and petroleum which was recommended by the ministers; and finally a great
  council of all the ministers, with the emperor presiding, determined the
  compromise that was at last accepted. In 1887 things went better; there
  was some difficulty about the tariff, especially about the tax on
  petroleum, but Count Taaffe had a stronger position than the Austrian
  ministers of 1877. Ten years later, on the third renewal, the
  difficulties were still greater. They sprang from a double cause. First
  the Austrians were determined to get a more favourable division of the
  common expenses; that of 1867 still continued, although Hungary had grown
  relatively in wealth.<a name="FnAnchor_0211"
  href="#Footnote_0211"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Moreover, a proposed alteration
  in the taxes on sugar would be of considerable advantage to Hungary; the
  Austrians, therefore, demanded that henceforth the proportion should be
  not 68.6:31.4 but 58:42. On this there was a deadlock; all through 1897
  and 1898 the Quota-Deputations failed to come to an agreement. This,
  however, was not the worst. Parliamentary government in Austria had
  broken down; the opposition had recourse to obstruction, and no business
  could be done. Their object was to drive out the Badeni government, and
  for that reason the obstruction was chiefly directed against the renewal
  of the Ausgleich; for, as this was the first necessity of state, no
  government could remain in office which failed to carry it through. The
  extreme parties of the Germans and the anti-Semites were also, for racial
  reasons, opposed to the whole system. When, therefore, the government at
  the end of 1897 introduced the necessary measures for prolonging the
  existing arrangements provisionally till the differences with Hungary had
  been settled, scenes of great disorder ensued, and at the end of the year
  the financial arrangements had not been prolonged, and neither the bank
  charter nor the Customs Union had been renewed. The government, therefore
  (Badeni having resigned), had to proclaim the necessary measures by
  imperial warrant. Next year it was even worse, for there was obstruction
  in Hungary as well as in Austria; the Quota-Deputations again came to no
  agreement, and the proposals for the renewal of the Bank charter, the
  reform of the currency, the renewal of the Customs Union, and the new
  taxes on beer and brandy, which were laid before parliament both at
  Vienna and Pest, were not carried in either country; this time,
  therefore, the existing arrangements had to be prolonged provisionally by
  imperial and royal warrant both in Austria and Hungary. During 1899
  parliamentary peace was restored in Hungary by the resignation of Bánffy;
  in Austria, however, though there was again a change of ministry the only
  result was that the Czechs imitated the example of the Germans and
  resorted to obstruction so that still no business could be done. The
  Austrian ministry, therefore, came to an agreement with the Hungarians
  that the terms of the new Ausgleich should be finally proclaimed in
  Austria by imperial warrant; the Hungarians only giving their assent to
  this in return for considerable financial concessions.</p>

  <p>The main points of the agreement were: (1) the Bank charter was to be
  renewed till 1910, the Hungarians receiving a larger share in the
  direction than they had hitherto enjoyed; (2) the Customs Union so far as
  it was based on a reciprocal and binding treaty lapsed, both sides,
  however, continuing it in practice, and promising to do so until the 31st
  of December 1907. Not later than 1901 negotiations were to be begun for a
  renewal of the alliance, and if possible it was to be renewed from the
  year 1903, in which year the commercial treaties would expire. If this
  were done, then the tariff would be revised before any fresh commercial
  treaties were made. If it were not done, then no fresh treaties would be
  made extending beyond the year 1907, so that if the Commercial Union of
  Austria and Hungary were not renewed before 1907, each party would be
  able to determine its own policy unshackled by any previous treaties.
  These arrangements in Hungary received the sanction of the parliament;
  but this could not be procured in Austria, and they were, therefore,
  proclaimed by imperial warrant; first of all, on 20th July, the new
  duties on beer, brandy and sugar; then on 23rd September the Bank
  charter, &amp;c. In November the Quota-Deputations at last agreed that
  Hungary should henceforward pay 33-3/49, a very small increase, and this
  was also in Austria proclaimed in the same way. The result was that a
  working agreement was made, by which the Union was preserved.</p>

  <p>(<span class="sc">J. W. He.</span>)</p>

  <p>Since the years 1866-1871 no period of Austro-Hungarian <span
  class="sidenote">Austro-Hungarian crisis, 1903-1907.</span> development
  has been so important as the years 1903-1907. The defeat of the old
  Austria by Prussia at Sadowa in 1866, the establishment of the Dual
  Monarchy in 1867 and the foundation of the new German empire in 1871,
  formed the starting-point of Austro-Hungarian history properly so called;
  but the Austro-Hungarian crisis of 1903-1906&mdash;a crisis temporarily
  settled but not definitively solved,&mdash;and the introduction of
  universal suffrage in Austria, discredited the original interpretation of
  the dual system and raised the question whether it represented the
  permanent form of the Austro-Hungarian polity.</p>

  <p>At the close of the 19th century both states of the Dual Monarchy were
  visited by political crises of some severity. Parliamentary life in
  Austria was paralysed by the feud between Germans and Czechs that
  resulted directly from the Badeni language ordinances of 1897 and
  indirectly from the development of Slav influence, particularly that of
  Czechs and Poles during the Taaffe era (1879-1893). Government in Austria
  was carried on by cabinets of officials with the help of the emergency
  clause (paragraph 14) of the constitution. Ministers, nominally
  responsible to parliament, were in practice responsible only to the
  emperor. Thus during the closing years of last and the opening years of
  the present century, political life in Austria was at a low ebb and the
  constitution was observed in the letter rather than in spirit.</p>

  <p>Hungary was apparently better situated. Despite the campaign of
  obstruction that overthrew the Bánffy and led to the formation of the
  Széll cabinet in 1899, the hegemony of the Liberal party which, under
  various names, had been the mainstay of dualism since 1867, appeared to
  be unshaken. But clear signs of the decay of the dualist and of the
  growth of an extreme nationalist Magyar spirit were already visible. The
  Army bills of 1889, which involved an increase of the peace footing of
  the joint Austro-Hungarian army, had been carried with difficulty,
  despite the efforts of Koloman Tisza and of Count Julius Andrássy the
  Elder. Demands tending towards the Magyarization of the joint army had
  been advanced and had found such an echo in Magyar public opinion that
  Count Andrássy was obliged solemnly to warn the country of the dangers of
  nationalist Chauvinism and to remind it of its obligations under the
  Compact of 1867. The struggle over the civil marriage and divorce laws
  that filled the greater part of the nineties served and was perhaps
  intended by the Liberal leaders to serve as a diversion in favour of the
  Liberal-dualist standpoint; nevertheless, Nationalist feeling found
  strong expression during the negotiations of Bánffy and Széll with
  various Austrian premiers for the renewal of the economic
  <i>Ausgleich</i>, or "Customs and Trade Alliance." At the end of 1902 the
  Hungarian premier, Széll, concluded with the Austrian premier, Körber, a
  new customs and trade alliance <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>[v.03 p.0023]</span>comprising a joint Austro-Hungarian
  tariff as a basis for the negotiation of new commercial treaties with
  Germany, Italy and other states. This arrangement, which for the sake of
  brevity will henceforth be referred to as the Széll-Körber Compact, was
  destined to play an important part in the history of the next few years,
  though it was never fully ratified by either parliament and was
  ultimately discarded. Its conclusion was prematurely greeted as the end
  of a period of economic strife between the two halves of the monarchy and
  as a pledge of a decade of peaceful development. Events were soon to
  demonstrate the baselessness of these hopes.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1902 the Austrian and the Hungarian <span
  class="sidenote">The Army question.</span> governments, at the instance
  of the crown and in agreement with the joint minister for war and the
  Austrian and Hungarian ministers for national defence, laid before their
  respective parliaments bills providing for an increase of 21,000 men in
  the annual contingents of recruits. 16,700 men were needed for the joint
  army, and the remainder for the Austrian and Hungarian national defence
  troops (Landwehr and honvéd). The total contribution of Hungary would
  have been some 6500 and of Austria some 14,500 men. The military
  authorities made, however, the mistake of detaining in barracks several
  thousand supernumerary recruits (<i>i.e.</i> recruits liable to military
  service but in excess of the annual 103,000 enrollable by law) pending
  the adoption of the Army bills by the two parliaments. The object of this
  apparently high-handed step was to avoid the expense and delay of
  summoning the supernumeraries again to the colours when the bills should
  have received parliamentary sanction; but it was not unnaturally resented
  by the Hungarian Chamber, which has ever possessed a lively sense of its
  prerogatives. The Opposition, consisting chiefly of the independence
  party led by Francis Kossuth (eldest son of Louis Kossuth), made capital
  out of the grievance and decided to obstruct ministerial measures until
  the supernumeraries should be discharged. The estimates could not be
  sanctioned, and though Kossuth granted the Széll cabinet a vote on
  account for the first four months of 1903, the Government found itself at
  the mercy of the Opposition. At the end of 1902 the supernumeraries were
  discharged&mdash;too late to calm the ardour of the Opposition, which
  proceeded to demand that the Army bills should be entirely withdrawn or
  that, if adopted, they should be counterbalanced by concessions to Magyar
  nationalist feeling calculated to promote the use of the Magyar language
  in the Hungarian part of the army and to render the Hungarian regiments,
  few of which are purely Magyar, more and more Magyar in character. Széll,
  who vainly advised the crown and the military authorities to make timely
  concessions, was obliged to reject these demands which enjoyed the secret
  support of Count Albert Apponyi, the Liberal president of the Chamber and
  of his adherents. The obstruction of the estimates continued. On the 1st
  of May the Széll cabinet found itself without supply and governed for a
  time "<i>ex-lex</i>"; Széll, who had lost the confidence of the crown,
  resigned and was succeeded (June 26) by Count Khuen-Hederváry, previously
  ban, or governor, of Croatia. Before taking office Khuen-Hederváry
  negotiated with Kossuth and other Opposition leaders, who undertook that
  obstruction should cease if the Army bills were withdrawn. Despite the
  fact that the Austrian Army bill had been voted by the Reichsrath
  (February 19), the crown consented to withdraw the bills and thus
  compelled the Austrian parliament to repeal, at the dictation of the
  Hungarian obstructionists, what it regarded as a patriotic measure.
  Austrian feeling became embittered towards Hungary and the action of the
  crown was openly criticized.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Hungarian Opposition broke its engagement. <span
  class="sidenote">The Magyar words of command.</span> Obstruction was
  continued by a section of the independence party; and Kossuth, seeing his
  authority ignored, resigned the leadership. The obstructionists now
  raised the cry that the German words of command in the joint army must be
  replaced by Magyar words in the regiments recruited from Hungary&mdash;a
  demand which, apart from its disintegrating influence on the army, the
  crown considered to be an encroachment upon the royal military
  prerogatives as defined by the Hungarian Fundamental Law XII. of 1867.
  Clause 11 of the law runs:&mdash;"In pursuance of the constitutional
  military prerogatives of His Majesty, everything relating to the unitary
  direction, leadership and inner organization of the whole army, and thus
  also of the Hungarian army as a complementary part of the whole army, is
  recognized as subject to His Majesty's disposal." The cry for the Magyar
  words of command on which the subsequent constitutional crisis turned,
  was tantamount to a demand that the monarch should differentiate the
  Hungarian from the Austrian part of the joint army, and should render it
  impossible for any but Magyar officers to command Hungarian regiments,
  less than half of which have a majority of Magyar recruits. The partisans
  of the Magyar words of command based their claim upon clause 12 of the
  Fundamental Law XII. of 1867&mdash;which runs:&mdash;"Nevertheless the
  country reserves its right periodically to complete the Hungarian army
  and the right of granting recruits, <i>the fixing of the conditions on
  which the recruits are granted,</i> the fixing of the term of service and
  all the dispositions concerning the stationing and the supplies of the
  troops according to existing law both as regards legislation and
  administration." Since Hungary reserved her right to fix the conditions
  on which recruits should be granted, the partisans of the Magyar words of
  command argued that the abolition of the German words of command in the
  Hungarian regiments might be made such a condition, despite the
  enumeration in the preceding clause 11, of everything appertaining to the
  unitary leadership and inner organization of the joint Austro-Hungarian
  army as belonging to the constitutional military prerogatives of the
  crown. Practically, the dispute was a trial of strength between Magyar
  nationalist feeling and the crown. Austrian feeling strongly supported
  the monarch in his determination to defend the unity of the army, and the
  conflict gradually acquired an intensity that appeared to threaten the
  very existence of the dual system.</p>

  <p>When Count Khuen-Hederváry took office and Kossuth relinquished the
  leadership of the independence party, the extension of the crisis could
  not be foreseen. A few extreme nationalists continued to obstruct the
  estimates, and it appeared as though their energy would soon flag. An
  attempt to quicken this process by bribery provoked, however, an outburst
  of feeling against Khuen-Hederváry who, though personally innocent, found
  his position shaken. Shortly afterwards Magyar resentment of an army
  order issued from the cavalry man&oelig;uvres at Chlopy in
  Galicia&mdash;in which the monarch declared that he would "hold fast to
  the existing and well-tried organization of the army" and would never
  "relinquish the rights and privileges guaranteed to its highest
  war-lord"; and of a provocative utterance of the Austrian premier Körber
  in the Reichsrath led to the overthrow of the Khuen-Hederváry cabinet
  (September 30) by an immense majority. The cabinet fell on a motion of
  censure brought forward by Kossuth, who had profited by the bribery
  incident to resume the leadership of his party.</p>

  <p>An interval of negotiation between the crown and many <span
  class="sidenote">Stephen Tisza.</span> leading Magyar Liberals followed,
  until at the end of October 1903 Count Stephen Tisza, son of Koloman
  Tisza, accepted a mission to form a cabinet after all others had
  declined. As programme Tisza brought with him a number of concessions
  from the crown to Magyar nationalist feeling in regard to military
  matters, particularly in regard to military badges, penal procedure, the
  transfer of officers of Hungarian origin from Austrian to Hungarian
  regiments, the establishment of military scholarships for Magyar youths
  and the introduction of the two years' service system. In regard to the
  military language, the Tisza programme&mdash;which, having been drafted
  by a committee of nine members, is known as the "programme of the
  nine"&mdash;declared that the responsibility of the cabinet extends to
  the military prerogatives of the crown, and that "the legal influence of
  parliament exists in this respect as in respect of every constitutional
  right." The programme, however, expressly excluded for "weighty political
  reasons affecting great interests of the nation" the question of the
  military <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[v.03
  p.0024]</span>language; and on Tisza's motion the Liberal party adopted
  an addendum, sanctioned by the crown: "the party maintains the standpoint
  that the king has a right to fix the language of service and command in
  the Hungarian army on the basis of his constitutional prerogatives as
  recognized in clause 11 of law XII. of 1867."</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the concessions, obstruction was continued by the
  Clericals and the extreme Independents, partly in the hope of compelling
  the crown to grant the Magyar words of command and partly out of
  antipathy towards the person of the young calvinist premier. In March
  1904, Tisza, therefore, introduced a drastic "guillotine" motion to amend
  the standing orders of the House, but withdrew it in return for an
  undertaking from the Opposition that obstruction would cease. This time
  the Opposition kept its word. The Recruits bill and the estimates were
  adopted, the Delegations were enabled to meet at Budapest&mdash;where
  they voted £22,000,000 as extraordinary estimates for the army and navy
  and especially for the renewal of the field artillery&mdash;and the
  negotiations for new commercial treaties with Germany and Italy were
  sanctioned, although parliament had never been able to ratify the
  Széll-Körber compact with the tariff on the basis of which the
  negotiations would have to be conducted. But, as the autumn session
  approached, Tisza foresaw a new campaign of obstruction, and resolved to
  revert to his drastic reform of the standing orders. The announcement of
  his determination caused the Opposition to rally against him, and when on
  the 18th of November the Liberal party adopted a "guillotine" motion by a
  show of hands in defiance of orthodox procedure, a section of the party
  seceded. On the 13th of December the Opposition, infuriated by the
  formation of a special corps of parliamentary constables, invaded and
  wrecked the Chamber. Tisza appealed to the country and suffered, on the
  26th of January 1905, an overwhelming defeat at the hands of a coalition
  composed of dissentient Liberals, Clericals, Independents and a few
  Bánffyites. The Coalition gained an absolute majority and the
  Independence party became the strongest political group. Nevertheless the
  various adherents of the dual system retained an actual majority in the
  Chamber and prevented the Independence party from attempting to realize
  its programme of reducing the ties between Hungary and Austria to the
  person of the joint ruler. On the 25th of January, the day before his
  defeat, Count Tisza had signed on behalf of Hungary the new commercial
  treaties concluded by the Austro-Hungarian foreign office with Germany
  and Italy on the basis of the Széll-Körber tariff. He acted <i>ultra
  vires</i>, but by his act saved Hungary from a severe economic crisis and
  retained for her the right to benefit by economic partnership with
  Austria until the expiry of the new treaties in 1917.</p>

  <p>A deadlock, lasting from January 1905 until April 1906, <span
  class="sidenote">Deadlock of 1905.</span> ensued between the crown and
  Hungary and, to a great extent, between Hungary and Austria. The
  Coalition, though possessing the majority in the Chamber, resolved not to
  take office unless the crown should grant its demands, including the
  Magyar words of command and customs separation from Austria. The crown
  declined to concede these points, either of which would have wrecked the
  dual system as interpreted since 1867. The Tisza cabinet could not be
  relieved of its functions till June 1905, when it was succeeded by a
  non-parliamentary administration under the premiership of General Baron
  Fejerváry, formerly minister for national defence. Seeing that the
  Coalition would not take office on acceptable terms, Fejerváry obtained
  the consent of the crown to a scheme, drafted by Kristóffy, minister of
  the interior, that the dispute between the crown and the Coalition should
  be subjected to the test of universal suffrage and that to this end the
  franchise in Hungary be radically reformed. The scheme alarmed the
  Coalition, which saw that universal suffrage might destroy not only the
  hegemony of the Magyar nobility and gentry in whose hands political power
  was concentrated, but might, by admitting the non-Magyars to political
  equality with the Magyars, undermine the supremacy of the Magyar race
  itself. Yet the Coalition did not yield at once. Not until the Chamber
  had been dissolved by military force (February 19, 1906) and an open
  breach of the constitution seemed within sight did they come to terms
  with the crown and form an administration. The miserable state of public
  finances and the depression of trade doubtless helped to induce them to
  perform a duty which they ought to have performed from the first; but
  their chief motive was the desire to escape the menace of universal
  suffrage or, at least, to make sure that it would be introduced in such a
  form as to safeguard Magyar supremacy over the other Hungarian races.</p>

  <p>The pact concluded (April 8, 1906) between the Coalition and <span
  class="sidenote">Pact of 1906.</span> the crown is known to have
  contained the following conditions:&mdash;All military questions to be
  suspended until after the introduction of universal suffrage; the
  estimates and the normal contingent of recruits to be voted for 1905 and
  1906; the extraordinary military credits, sanctioned by the delegations
  in 1904, to be voted by the Hungarian Chamber; ratification of the
  commercial treaties concluded by Tisza; election of the Hungarian
  Delegation and of the Quota-Deputation; introduction of a suffrage reform
  at least as far reaching as the Kristóffy scheme. These "capitulations"
  obliged the Coalition government to carry on a dualist policy, although
  the majority of its adherents became, by the general election of May
  1906, members of the Kossuth or Independence party, and, as such, pledged
  to the economic and political separation of Hungary from Austria save as
  regards the person of the ruler. Attempts were, however, made to
  emphasize the independence of Hungary. During the deadlock (June 2, 1905)
  Kossuth had obtained the adoption of a motion to authorize the
  compilation of an autonomous Hungarian tariff, and on the 28th of May
  1906, the Coalition cabinet was authorized by the crown to present the
  Széll-Körber tariff to the Chamber in the form of a Hungarian autonomous
  tariff distinct from but identical with the Austrian tariff. This
  concession of form having been made to the Magyars without the knowledge
  of the Austrian government, Prince Konrad Hohenlohe, the Austrian
  premier, resigned office; and his successor, Baron Beck, eventually (July
  6) withdrew from the table of the Reichsrath the whole Széll-Körber
  compact, declaring that the only remaining economic ties between the two
  countries were freedom of trade, the commercial treaties with foreign
  countries, the joint state bank and the management of excise. If the
  Hungarian government wished to regulate its relationship to Austria in a
  more definite form, added the Austrian premier, it must conclude a new
  agreement before the end of the year 1907, when the reciprocity
  arrangement of 1899 would lapse. The Hungarian government replied that
  any new arrangement with Austria must be concluded in the form of a
  commercial treaty as between two foreign states and not in the form of a
  "customs and trade alliance."</p>

  <p>Austria ultimately consented to negotiate on this basis. <span
  class="sidenote">Agreement of 1907.</span> In October 1907 an agreement
  was attained, thanks chiefly to the sobering of Hungarian opinion by a
  severe economic crisis, which brought out with unusual clearness the fact
  that separation from Austria would involve a period of distress if not of
  commercial ruin for Hungary. Austria also came to see that separation
  from Hungary would seriously enhance the cost of living in Cisleithania
  and would deprive Austrian manufacturers of their best market. The main
  features of the new "customs and commercial treaty" were: (1) Each state
  to possess a separate but identical customs tariff. (2) Hungary to
  facilitate the establishment of direct railway communication between
  Vienna and Dalmatia, the communication to be established by the end of
  1911, each state building the sections of line that passed through its
  own territory. (3) Austria to facilitate railway communication between
  Hungary and Prussia. (4) Hungary to reform her produce and Stock Exchange
  laws so as to prevent speculation in agrarian produce. (5) A court of
  arbitration to be established for the settlement of differences between
  the two states, Hungary selecting four Austrian and Austria four
  Hungarian judges, the presidency of the court being decided by lot, and
  each government being represented before the court by its own delegates.
  (6) Impediments <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>[v.03 p.0025]</span>to free trade in sugar to be
  practically abolished. (7) Hungary to be entitled to redeem her share of
  the old Austrian debt (originally bearing interest at 5 and now at 4.2%)
  at the rate of 4.325% within the next ten years; if not redeemed within
  ten years the rate of capitalization to decrease annually by 1/12% until
  it reaches 4.2%. This arrangement represents a potential economy of some
  £2,000,000 capital for Hungary as compared with the original Austrian
  demand that the Hungarian contribution to the service of the old Austrian
  debt be capitalized at 4.2%. (8) The securities of the two governments to
  rank as investments for savings banks, insurance companies and similar
  institutions in both countries, but not as trust fund investments. (9)
  Commercial treaties with foreign countries to be negotiated, not, as
  hitherto, by the joint minister for foreign affairs alone, but also by a
  nominee of each government. (10) The quota of Austrian and Hungarian
  contribution to joint expenditure to be 63.6 and 36.4
  respectively&mdash;an increase of 2% in the Hungarian quota, equal to
  some £200,000 a year.</p>

  <p>The economic dispute between Hungary and Austria was thus settled for
  ten years after negotiations lasting more than twelve years. One
  important question, however, that of the future of the joint State Bank,
  was left over for subsequent decision. During the negotiations for the
  customs and commercial treaty, the Austrian government attempted to
  conclude for a longer period than ten years, but was unable to overcome
  Hungarian resistance. Therefore, at the end of 1917, the commercial
  treaties with Germany, Italy and other countries, and the
  Austro-Hungarian customs and commercial treaty, would all lapse. Ten
  years of economic unity remained during which the Dual Monarchy might
  grow together or grow asunder, increasing accordingly in strength or in
  weakness.</p>

  <p>(H. W. S.)</p>

  <p>During this period of internal crisis the international position of
  the Dual Monarchy was threatened by two external dangers. The unrest in
  Macedonia threatened to reopen the Eastern Question in an acute form;
  with Italy the irredentist attitude of the Zanardelli cabinet led in
  1902-1903 to such strained relations that war seemed imminent. The
  southern Tirol, the chief passes into Italy, strategic points on the
  Istrian and Dalmatian coasts, were strongly fortified, while in the
  interior the Tauern, Karawanken and Wochein railways were constructed,
  partly in order to facilitate the movement of troops towards the Italian
  border. The tension was relaxed with the fall of the Zanardelli
  government, and comparatively cordial relations were gradually
  re-established.</p>

  <p>In the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula a temporary agreement <span
  class="sidenote">Balkan crisis.</span> with Russia was reached in 1903 by
  the so-called "February Programme," supplemented in the following October
  by the "Mürzsteg Programme" (see <span class="sc">Macedonia</span>; <span
  class="sc">Turkey</span>; <span class="sc">Europe</span>:
  <i>History</i>). The terms of the Mürzsteg programme were observed by
  Count Goluchowski, in spite of the ruin of Russian prestige in the war
  with Japan, so long as he remained in office. In October 1906, however,
  he retired, and it was soon clear that his successor, Baron von
  Aerenthal,<a name="FnAnchor_0212"
  href="#Footnote_0212"><sup>[12]</sup></a> was determined to take
  advantage of the changed European situation to take up once more the
  traditional policy of the Habsburg monarchy in the Balkan Peninsula. He
  gradually departed from the Mürzsteg basis, and in January 1908
  deliberately undermined the Austro-Russian agreement by obtaining from
  the sultan a concession for a railway from the Bosnian frontier through
  the sanjak of Novibazar to the Turkish terminus at Mitrovitza. This was
  done in the teeth of the expressed wish of Russia; it roused the helpless
  resentment of Servia, whose economic dependence upon the Dual Monarchy
  was emphasized by the outcome of the war of tariffs into which she had
  plunged in 1906, and who saw in this scheme another link in the chain
  forged for her by the Habsburg empire; it offended several of the great
  powers, who seemed to see in this railway concession the price of the
  abandonment by Austria-Hungary of her interest in Macedonian reforms.
  That Baron von Aerenthal was able to pursue a policy apparently so rash,
  was due to the fact that he could reckon on the support of Germany. The
  intimate relations between the two powers had been revealed during the
  dispute between France and Germany about Morocco; in the critical
  division of the 3rd of March 1906 at the Algeciras Conference
  Austria-Hungary, alone of all the powers, had sided with Germany, and it
  was a proposal of the Austro-Hungarian plenipotentiary that formed the
  basis of the ultimate settlement between Germany and France (see <span
  class="sc">Morocco</span>: <i>History</i>). The cordial relations thus
  emphasized encouraged Baron Aerenthal, in the autumn of 1908, to pursue a
  still bolder policy. The revolution in Turkey had entirely changed the
  face of the Eastern Question; the problem of Macedonian reform was
  swallowed up in that of the reform of the Ottoman empire generally, there
  was even a danger that a rejuvenated Turkey might in time lay claim to
  the provinces occupied by Austria-Hungary under the treaty of Berlin; in
  any case, the position of these provinces, governed autocratically from
  Vienna, between a constitutional Turkey and a constitutional
  Austria-Hungary, would have been highly anomalous. In the circumstances
  Baron Aerenthal determined on a bold policy. Without consulting the
  co-signatory powers of the treaty of Berlin, and in deliberate violation
  of its provisions, the king-emperor issued, on the 13th of October, a
  decree annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Habsburg Monarchy, and at
  the same time announcing the withdrawal of the Austro-Hungarian troops
  from the sanjak of Novibazar. (See <span class="sc">Europe</span>:
  <i>History</i>.)</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the relations between the two halves of the Dual <span
  class="sidenote">Internal difficulties.</span> Monarchy had again become
  critical. The agreement of 1907 had been but a truce in the battle
  between two irreconcilable principles: between Magyar nationalism,
  determined to maintain its ascendancy in an independent Hungary, and
  Habsburg imperialism, equally determined to preserve the economic and
  military unity of the Dual Monarchy. In this conflict the tactical
  advantage lay with the monarchy; for the Magyars were in a minority in
  Hungary, their ascendancy was based on a narrow and artificial franchise,
  and it was open to the king-emperor to hold <i>in terrorem</i> over them
  an appeal to the disfranchised majority. It was the introduction of a
  Universal Suffrage Bill by Mr Joseph Kristóffy, minister of the interior
  in the "unconstitutional" cabinet of Baron Fejérváry, which brought the
  Opposition leaders in the Hungarian parliament to terms and made possible
  the agreement of 1907. But the Wekerle ministry which succeeded that of
  Fejérváry on the 9th of April 1906 contained elements which made any
  lasting compromise impossible. The burning question of the "Magyar word
  of command" remained unsettled, save in so far as the fixed determination
  of the king-emperor had settled it; the equally important question of the
  renewal of the charter of the Austro-Hungarian State Bank had also formed
  no part of the agreement of 1907. On the other hand, the Wekerle ministry
  was pledged to a measure of franchise reform, a pledge which they showed
  no eagerness to redeem, though the granting of universal suffrage in the
  Austrian half of the Monarchy had made such a change inevitable. In March
  1908 Mr Hallo laid before the Hungarian parliament a formal proposal that
  the charter of the Austro-Hungarian Bank, which was to expire at the end
  of 1910, should not be renewed; and that, in the event of failure to
  negotiate a convention between the banks of Austria and Hungary, a
  separate Hungarian Bank should be established. This question, obscured
  during the winter by the Balkan crisis, once more became acute in the
  spring of 1909. In the Coalition cabinet itself opinion was sharply
  divided, but in the end the views of the Independence party prevailed,
  and Dr Wekerle laid the proposal for a separate Hungarian Bank before the
  king-emperor and the Austrian government. Its reception was significant.
  The emperor Francis Joseph pointed out that the question of a separate
  Bank for Hungary <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>[v.03 p.0026]</span>did not figure in the act of 1867,
  and could not be introduced into it, <i>especially since the capital
  article of the ministerial programme</i>, i.e. <i>electoral reform, was
  not realized, nor near being realized</i>. This was tantamount to an
  appeal from the Magyar <i>populus</i> to the Hungarian <i>plebs</i>, the
  disfranchised non-Magyar majority; an appeal all the more significant
  from the fact that it ignored the suffrage bill brought in on behalf of
  the Hungarian government by Count Julius Andrássy in November 1908, a
  bill which, under the guise of granting the principle of universal
  suffrage, was ingeniously framed so as to safeguard and even to extend
  Magyar ascendancy (see <span class="sc">Hungary</span>: <i>History</i>).
  In consequence of this rebuff Dr Wekerle tendered his resignation on the
  27th of April. Months passed without it being possible to form a new
  cabinet, and a fresh period of crisis and agitation was begun.</p>

  <p>(W. A. P.)</p>

<p class="cenhead">II. <i>Austria Proper since</i> 1867.</p>

  <p>As already explained, the name Austria is used for convenience to
  designate those portions of the possessions of the house of Habsburg,
  which were not included by the settlement of 1867 among the lands of the
  Hungarian crown. The separation of Hungary made it necessary to determine
  the method by which these territories<a name="FnAnchor_0213"
  href="#Footnote_0213"><sup>[13]</sup></a> were henceforth to be governed.
  It was the misfortune of the country that there was no clear legal basis
  on which new institutions could be erected. Each of the territories was a
  separate political unit with a separate history, and some of them had a
  historic claim to a large amount of self-government; in many the old
  feudal estates had survived till 1848. <span class="sidenote">The
  February Constitution.</span> Since that year the empire had been the
  subject of numerous experiments in government; by the last, which began
  in 1860, <i>Landtage</i> or diets have been instituted in each of the
  territories on a nearly uniform system and with nearly identical powers,
  and by the constitution published in February 1861 (the February
  Constitution, as it is called), which is still the ultimate basis for the
  government, there was instituted a <i>Reichsrath</i> or parliament for
  the whole empire; it consisted of a House of Lords (<i>Herrenhaus</i>),
  in which sat the archbishops and prince bishops, members of the imperial
  family, and other members appointed for life, besides some hereditary
  members, and a Chamber of Deputies. The members of the latter for each
  territory were not chosen by direct election, but by the diets. The diets
  themselves were elected for six years; they were chosen generally (there
  were slight local differences) in the following way: (<i>a</i>) a certain
  number of bishops and rectors of universities sat in virtue of their
  office; (<i>b</i>) the rest of the members were chosen by four electoral
  bodies or <i>curiae</i>,&mdash;(1) the owners of estates which before
  1848 had enjoyed certain feudal privileges, the so-called great
  proprietors; (2) the chambers of commerce; (3) the towns; (4) the rural
  districts. In the two latter classes all had the suffrage who paid at
  least ten gulden in direct taxes. The districts were so arranged as to
  give the towns a very large representation in proportion to their
  populations. In Bohemia, <i>e.g.</i>, the diet consisted of 241 members:
  of these five were <i>ex officio</i> members; the feudal proprietors had
  seventy; the towns and chambers of commerce together had eighty-seven;
  the rural districts seventy-nine. The electors in the rural districts
  were 236,000, in the towns 93,000. This arrangement seems to have been
  deliberately made by Schmerling, so as to give greater power to the
  German inhabitants of the towns; the votes of the proprietors would,
  moreover, nearly always give the final decision to the court and the
  government, for the influence exercised by the government over the
  nobility would generally be strong enough to secure a majority in favour
  of the government policy.</p>

  <p>This constitution had failed; territories so different in size,
  history and circumstances were not contented with similar institutions,
  and a form of self-government which satisfied Lower Austria and Salzburg
  did not satisfy Galicia and Bohemia. The Czechs of Bohemia, like the
  Magyars, had refused to recognize the common parliament on the ground
  that it violated the historic rights of the Bohemian as of the Hungarian
  crown, and in 1865 the constitution of 1861 had been superseded, while
  the territorial diets remained. In 1867 it was necessary once more to
  summon, in some form or another, a common parliament for the whole of
  Austria, by which the settlement with Hungary could be ratified.</p>

  <p>This necessity brought to a decisive issue the struggle between <span
  class="sidenote">Centralists and Federalists.</span> the parties of the
  Centralists and Federalists. The latter claimed that the new constitution
  must be made by agreement with the territories; the former maintained
  that the constitution of 1861 was still valid, and demanded that in
  accordance with it the Reichsrath should be summoned and a
  "constitutional" government restored. The difference between the two
  parties was to a great extent, though not entirely, one of race. The
  kernel of the empire was the purely German district, including Upper and
  Lower Austria, Salzburg, Tirol (except the south) and Vorarlberg, all
  Styria except the southern districts, and a large part of Carinthia.
  There was strong local feeling, especially in Tirol, but it was local
  feeling similar to that which formerly existed in the provinces of
  France; among all classes and parties there was great, loyalty both to
  the ruling house and to the idea of the Austrian state; but while the
  Liberal party, which was dominant in Lower Austria and Styria, desired to
  develop the central institutions, there was a strong Conservative and
  Clerical party which supported local institutions as a protection against
  the Liberal influence of a centralized parliament and bureaucracy, and
  the bishops and clergy were willing to gain support in the struggle by
  alliance with the Federalists.</p>

  <p>Very different was it in the other territories where the majority
  <span class="sidenote">The Slavonic Lands.</span> of the population was
  not German&mdash;and where there was a lively recollection of the time
  when they were not Austrian. With Palacky, they said, "We existed before
  Austria; we shall continue to exist after it is gone." Especially was
  this the case in Bohemia. In this great country, the richest part of the
  Austrian dominions, where over three-fifths of the population were Czech,
  racial feeling was supported by the appeal to historic law. A great
  party, led by Palacky and Rieger, demanded the restoration of the
  Bohemian monarchy in its fullest extent, including Moravia and Silesia,
  and insisted that the emperor should be crowned as king of Bohemia at
  Prague as his predecessors had been, and that Bohemia should have a
  position in the monarchy similar to that obtained by Hungary. Not only
  did the party include all the Czechs, but they were supported by many of
  the great nobles who were of German descent, including Count Leo Thun,
  his brother-in-law Count Heinrich Clam-Martinitz, and Prince Friedrich
  von Schwarzenberg, cardinal archbishop of Prague, who hoped in a
  self-governing kingdom of Bohemia to preserve that power which was
  threatened by the German Liberals. The feudal nobles had great power
  arising from their wealth, the great traditions of their families, and
  the connexion with the court, and by the electoral law they had a large
  number of representatives in the diet. On the other hand the Germans of
  Bohemia, fearful of falling under the control of the Czechs, were the
  most ardent advocates of centralization. The Czechs were supported also
  by their fellow-countrymen in Moravia, and some of the nobles, headed by
  Count Belcredi, brother of the minister; but in Brünn there was a strong
  German party. In Silesia the Germans had a considerable majority, and as
  <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[v.03
  p.0027]</span>there was a large Polish element which did not support the
  Czechs, the diet refused to recognize the claims of the Bohemians.</p>

  <p>The Poles of Galicia stood apart from the other Slav races. The
  German-speaking population was very small, consisting chiefly of
  government officials, railway servants and Jews; but there was a large
  minority (some 43%) of Ruthenes. The Poles wished to gain as much
  autonomy as they could for their own province, but they had no interest
  in opposing the centralization of other parts; they were satisfied if
  Austria would surrender the Ruthenes to them. They were little influenced
  by the pan-Slav agitation; it was desirable for them that Austria, which
  gave them freedom and power, should continue strong and united. Their
  real interests were outside the monarchy, and they did not cease to look
  forward to a restoration of the Polish kingdom. The great danger was that
  they might entangle Austria in a war with Russia.</p>

  <p>The southern Slavs had neither the unity, nor the organization, nor
  the historical traditions of the Czechs and Poles; but the Slovenes, who
  formed a large majority of the population in Carniola, and a considerable
  minority in the adjoining territory of Carinthia and the south of Styria,
  demanded that their language should be used for purposes of government
  and education. Their political ideal was an "Illyrian" kingdom, including
  Croatia and all the southern Slavs in the coast district, and a not very
  successful movement had been started to establish a so-called Illyrian
  language, which should be accepted by both Croats and Slovenes. There
  was, however, another element in the southern districts, viz. the Serbs,
  who, though of the same race and language as the Croats, were separated
  from them by religion. Belonging to the Orthodox Church they were
  attracted by Russia. They were in constant communication with Servia and
  Montenegro; and their ultimate hope, the creation of a great Servian
  kingdom, was less easy to reconcile with loyalty to Austria. Of late
  years attempts have been made to turn the Slovenian national movement
  into this direction, and to attract the Slovenes also towards the
  Orthodox non-Austrian Slavs.</p>

  <p>In the extreme south of Dalmatia is a small district which had <span
  class="sidenote">South Dalmatia.</span> not formed part of the older
  duchy of Dalmatia, and had not been joined to the Austrian empire till
  1814; in former years part of it formed the republic of Ragusa, and the
  rest belonged to Albania. The inhabitants of this part, who chiefly
  belonged to the Greek Church, still kept up a close connexion with
  Albania and with Montenegro, and Austrian authority was maintained with
  difficulty. Disturbances had already broken out once before; and in 1869
  another outbreak took place. This district had hitherto been exempted
  from military service; by the law of 1869, which introduced universal
  military service, those who had hitherto been exempted were required to
  serve, not in the regular army but in the militia. The inhabitants of the
  district round the Bocche di Cattaro (the Bocchesi, as they are commonly
  called) refused to obey this order, and when a military force was sent it
  failed to overcome their resistance; and by an agreement made at Knezlac
  in December 1869, Rodics, who had taken command, granted the insurgents
  all they asked and a complete amnesty. After the conquest of Bosnia
  another attempt was made to enforce military service; once more a
  rebellion broke out, and spread to the contiguous districts of
  Herzegovina. This time, however, the government, whose position in the
  Balkans had been much strengthened by the occupation of the new
  provinces, did not fear to act with decision. A considerable force was
  sent under General Baron Stephan von Jovanovich (1828-1885); they were
  supported from sea by the navy, and eventually the rebellion was crushed.
  An amnesty was proclaimed, but the greater number of the insurgents
  sought refuge in Montenegro rather than submit to military service.</p>

  <p>The Italians of Trieste and Istria were the only people of the empire
  who really desired separation from Austria; annexation to Italy was the
  aim of the <i>Italianissimi</i>, as they were called. The feeling was
  less strong in Tirol, where, except in the city of Trent, they seem
  chiefly to have wished for separate local institutions, so that they
  should no longer be governed from Innsbruck. The Italian-speaking
  population on the coast of Dalmatia only asked that the government should
  uphold them against the pressure of the Slav races in the interior, and
  for this reason were ready to support the German constitutionalists.</p>

  <p>The party of centralization was then the Liberal German <span
  class="sidenote">German Constitutional party.</span> party, supported by
  a few Italians and the Ruthenes, and as years went by it was to become
  the National German party. They hoped by a common parliament to create
  the feeling of a common Austrian nationality, by German schools to spread
  the use of the German language. Every grant of self-government to the
  territories must diminish the influence of the Germans, and bring about a
  restriction in the use of the German language; moreover, in countries
  such as Bohemia, full self-government would almost certainly mean that
  the Germans would become the subject race. This was a result which they
  could not accept. It was intolerable to them that just at the time when
  the national power of the non-Austrian Germans was so greatly increased,
  and the Germans were becoming the first race in Europe, they themselves
  should resign the position as rulers which they had won during the last
  three hundred years. They maintained, moreover, that the ascendancy of
  the Germans was the only means of preserving the unity of the monarchy;
  German was the only language in which the different races could
  communicate with one another; it must be the language of the army, the
  civil service and the parliament. They laid much stress on the historic
  task of Austria in bringing German culture to the half-civilized races of
  the east. They demanded, therefore, that all higher schools and
  universities should remain German, and that so far as possible the
  elementary schools should be Germanized. They looked on the German
  schoolmaster as the apostle of German culture, and they looked forward to
  the time when the feeling of a common Austrian nationality should obscure
  the national feeling of the Slavs, and the Slavonic idioms should survive
  merely as the local dialects of the peasantry, the territories becoming
  merely the provinces of a united and centralized state. The total German
  population was not quite a third of the whole. The maintenance of their
  rule was, therefore, only possible by the exercise of great political
  ability, the more so, since, as we have seen, they were not united among
  themselves, the clergy and Feudal party being opposed to the Liberals.
  Their watchword was the constitution of 1861, which had been drawn up by
  their leaders; they demanded that it should be restored, and with it
  parliamentary government. They called themselves, therefore, the
  Constitutional party. But the introduction of parliamentary government
  really added greatly to the difficulty of the task before them. In the
  old days German ascendancy had been secured by the common army, the civil
  service and the court. As soon, however, as power was transferred to a
  parliament, the Germans must inevitably be in a minority, unless the
  method of election was deliberately arranged so as to give them a
  majority. Parliamentary discussion, moreover, was sure to bring out those
  racial differences which it was desirable should be forgotten, and the
  elections carried into every part of the empire a political agitation
  which was very harmful when each party represented a different race.</p>

  <p>The very first events showed one of those extraordinary changes of
  policy so characteristic of modern Austrian history. The decision of the
  government on the constitutional question was really determined by
  immediate practical necessity. The Hungarians required that the
  settlement should be ratified by a parliament, therefore a parliament
  must be procured which would do this. <span class="sidenote">Crisis of
  1867.</span> It must be a parliament in which the Germans had a majority,
  for the system of dualism was directly opposed to the ambitions of the
  Slavs and the Federalists. Belcredi, who had come into power in 1865 as a
  Federalist, and had suspended the constitution of 1861 on the 2nd of
  January 1867, ordered new elections for the diets, which were then to
  elect deputies to an extraordinary Reichsrath which should consider the
  <i>Ausgleich</i>, or compact with Hungary. The wording of the decree
  implied that the February constitution did not exist as of law; the
  Germans and Liberals, strenuously objecting to a "feudal-federal"
  constitution which would give the Slavs a preponderance in the empire,
  maintained that the February constitution was still in force, and that
  changes could only be introduced by a regular Reichsrath summoned in
  accordance with it, protested against the decree, and, in some cases,
  threatened not to take part in the elections. As the Federalists <!--
  Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[v.03
  p.0028]</span>were all opposed to the Ausgleich, it was clear that a
  Reichsrath chosen in these circumstances would refuse to ratify it, and
  this was probably Belcredi's intention. As the existence of the empire
  would thereby be endangered, Beust interfered; Belcredi was dismissed,
  Beust himself became minister-president on the 7th of February 1867, and
  a new edict was issued from Vienna ordering the diets to elect a
  Reichsrath, according to the constitution, which was now said to be
  completely valid. Of course, however, those diets in which there was a
  Federalist majority, viz. those of Bohemia, Moravia, Carinthia and Tirol,
  which were already pledged to support the January policy of the
  government, did not acquiesce in the February policy; and they refused to
  elect except on terms which the government could not accept. The first
  three were immediately dissolved. In the elections which followed in
  Bohemia the influence of the government was sufficient to secure a German
  majority among the landed proprietors; the Czechs, who were therefore in
  a minority, declared the elections invalid, refused to take any part in
  electing deputies for the Reichsrath, and seceded altogether from the
  diet. The result was that Bohemia now sent a large German majority to
  Vienna, and the few Czechs who were chosen refused to take their seat in
  the parliament. <span class="sidenote">Beust's compact with the
  Poles.</span> Had the example of the Czechs been followed by the other
  Slav races it would still have been difficult to get together a
  Reichsrath to pass the Ausgleich. It was, however, easier to deal with
  the Poles of Galicia, for they had no historical rights to defend; and by
  sending delegates to Vienna they would not sacrifice any principle or
  prejudice any legal claim; they had only to consider how they could make
  the best bargain. Their position was a strong one; their votes were
  essential to the government, and the government could be useful to them;
  it could give them the complete control over the Ruthenes. A compact then
  was easily arranged.</p>

  <p>Beust promised them that there should be a special minister for
  Galicia, a separate board for Galician education, that Polish should be
  the language of instruction in all secondary schools, that Polish instead
  of German should be the official language in the law courts and public
  offices, Ruthenian being only used in the elementary schools under strict
  limitations. On these terms the Polish deputies, led by Ziemialkowski,
  agreed to go to Vienna and vote for the Ausgleich.</p>

  <p>When the Reichsrath met, the government had a large <span
  class="sidenote">The constitution of 1867.</span> majority; and in the
  House, in which all the races except the Czechs were represented, the
  Ausgleich was ratified almost unanimously. This having been done, it was
  possible to proceed to special legislation for the territories, which
  were henceforward officially known as "the kingdoms and lands represented
  in the Reichsrath." A series of fundamental laws were carried, which
  formally established parliamentary government, with responsibility of
  ministers, and complete control over the budget, and there were included
  a number of clauses guaranteeing personal rights and liberties in the way
  common to all modern constitutions. The influence of the Poles was still
  sufficient to secure considerable concessions to the wishes of the
  Federalists, since if they did not get what they wished they would leave
  the House, and the Slovenes, Dalmatians and Tirolese would certainly
  follow them. Hence the German Liberals were prevented from introducing
  direct elections to the Reichsrath, and the functions of the Reichsrath
  were slightly less extensive than they had hitherto been. Moreover, the
  Delegation was to be chosen not by the House as a whole, but by the
  representatives of the separate territories. This is one reason for the
  comparative weakness of Austria as compared with Hungary, where the
  Delegation is elected by each House as a whole; the Bohemian
  representatives, <i>e.g.</i>, meet and choose 10 delegates, the Galicians
  7, those from Trieste 1; the Delegation, is, therefore, not
  representative of the majority of the chamber of deputies, but includes
  representatives of all the groups which may be opposing the government
  there, and they can carry on their opposition even in the Delegation. So
  it came about in 1869, that on the first occasion when there was a joint
  sitting of the Delegations to settle a point in the budget, which Hungary
  had accepted and Austria rejected, the Poles and Tirolese voted in favour
  of the Hungarian proposal.</p>

  <p>As soon as these laws had been carried (December 1867), <span
  class="sidenote">The Bürger Ministerium.</span> Beust retired from the
  post of minister-president; and in accordance with constitutional
  practice a parliamentary ministry was appointed entirely from the ranks
  of the Liberal majority; a ministry generally known as the "Bürger
  Ministerium" in which Giskra and Herbst&mdash;the leaders of the German
  party in Moravia and Bohemia&mdash;were the most important members.
  Austria now began its new life as a modern constitutional state. From
  this time the maintenance of the revised constitution of 1867 has been
  the watchword of what is called the Constitutional party. The first use
  which the new government made of their power was to settle the finances,
  and in this their best work was done. Among them were nearly all the
  representatives of trade and industry, of commercial enterprise and
  financial speculation; they were the men who hoped to make Austria a
  great industrial state, and at this time they were much occupied with
  railway enterprise. Convinced free-traders, they hoped by private energy
  to build up the fortunes of the country, parliamentary
  government&mdash;which meant for them the rule of the educated and
  well-to-do middle class&mdash;being one of the means to this end. They
  accepted the great burden of debt which the action of Hungary imposed
  upon the country, and rejected the proposals for repudiation, but
  notwithstanding the protest of foreign bondholders they imposed a tax of
  16% on all interest on the debt. They carried out an extension of the
  commercial treaty with Great Britain by which a further advance was made
  in the direction of free trade.</p>

  <p>Of equal importance was their work in freeing Austria from <span
  class="sidenote">The Liberals and the concordat.</span> the control of
  the Church, which checked the intellectual life of the people. The
  concordat of 1855 had given the Church complete freedom in the management
  of all ecclesiastical affairs; there was full liberty of intercourse with
  Rome, the state gave up all control over the appointment of the clergy,
  and in matters of church discipline the civil courts had no
  voice&mdash;the clergy being absolutely subject to the power of the
  bishops, who could impose temporal as well as spiritual penalties. The
  state had even resigned to the Church all authority over some departments
  of civil life, and restored the authority of the canon law. This was the
  case as regards marriage; all disputes were to be tried before
  ecclesiastical courts, and the marriage registers were kept by the
  priests. All the schools were under the control of the Church; the
  bishops could forbid the use of books prejudicial to religion; in
  elementary schools all teachers were subject to the inspection of the
  Church, and in higher schools only Roman Catholics could be appointed. It
  had been agreed that the whole education of the Roman Catholic youth, in
  all schools, private as well as public, should be in accordance with the
  teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. The authority of the Church
  extended even to the universities. Some change in this system was
  essential; the Liberal party demanded that the government should simply
  state that the concordat had ceased to exist. To this, however, the
  emperor would not assent, and there was a difficulty in overthrowing an
  act which took the form of a treaty. The government wished to come to
  some agreement by friendly discussion with Rome, but Pius IX. was not
  willing to abate anything of his full claims. The ministry, therefore,
  proceeded by internal legislation, and in 1868 introduced three laws: (1)
  a marriage law transferred the decisions on all questions of marriage
  from the ecclesiastical to the civil courts, abolished the authority of
  the canon law, and introduced civil marriage in those cases where the
  clergy refused to perform the ceremony; (2) the control of secular
  education was taken from the Church, and the management of schools
  transferred to local authorities which were to be created by the diets;
  (3) complete civil equality between Catholics and non-Catholics was
  established. These laws were carried through both Houses in May amid
  almost unparalleled excitement, and at once received the imperial
  sanction, notwithstanding the protest of all the bishops, led by Joseph
  Othmar <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[v.03
  p.0029]</span>von Rauscher (1797-1875), cardinal archbishop of Vienna,
  who had earned his red hat by the share he had taken in arranging the
  concordat of 1855, and now attempted to use his great personal influence
  with the emperor (his former pupil) to defeat the bill.</p>

  <p>The ministry had the enthusiastic support of the German population in
  the towns. They were also supported by the teaching profession, which
  desired emancipation from ecclesiastical control, and hoped that German
  schools and German railways were to complete the work which Joseph II.
  had begun. But the hostility of the Church was dangerous. The pope, in an
  allocution of 22nd June 1868, declared that these "damnable and
  abominable laws" which were "contrary to the concordat, to the laws of
  the Church and to the principles of Christianity," were "absolutely and
  for ever null and void." The natural result was that when they were
  carried into effect the bishops in many cases refused to obey. They
  claimed that the laws were inconsistent with the concordat, that the
  concordat still was in force, and that the laws were consequently
  invalid. The argument was forcible, but the courts decided against them.
  Rudigier, bishop of Linz, was summoned to a criminal court for disturbing
  the public peace; he refused to appear, for by the concordat bishops were
  not subject to temporal jurisdiction; and when he was condemned to
  imprisonment the emperor at once telegraphed his full pardon. In the
  rural districts the clergy had much influence; they were supported by the
  peasants, and the diets of Tirol and Vorarlberg, where there was a
  clerical majority, refused to carry out the school law.</p>

  <p>On the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870, the government
  took the opportunity of declaring that the concordat had lapsed, on the
  ground that there was a fundamental change in the character of the
  papacy. Nearly all the Austrian prelates had been opposed to the new
  doctrine; many of them remained to the end of the council and voted
  against it, and they only declared their submission with great
  reluctance. The Old Catholic movement, however, never made much progress
  in Austria. Laws regulating the position of the Church were carried in
  1874. (For the concordat see Laveleye, <i>La Prusse et l'Autriche</i>,
  Paris, 1870.)</p>

  <p>During 1868 the constitution then was open to attack on two <span
  class="sidenote">Nationalism in Galicia and Bohemia.</span> sides, for
  the nationalist movement was gaining ground in Bohemia and Galicia. In
  Galicia the extreme party, headed by Smolka, had always desired to
  imitate the Czechs and not attend at Vienna; they were outvoted, but all
  parties agreed on a declaration in which the final demands of the Poles
  were drawn up;<a name="FnAnchor_0214"
  href="#Footnote_0214"><sup>[14]</sup></a> they asked that the powers of
  the Galician diet should be much increased, and that the members from
  Galicia should cease to attend the Reichsrath on the discussion of those
  matters with which the Galician diet should be qualified to deal. If
  these demands were not granted they would leave the Reichsrath. In
  Bohemia the Czechs were very active; while the Poles were parading their
  hostility to Russia in such a manner as to cause the emperor to avoid
  visiting Galicia, some of the Czech leaders attended a Slav demonstration
  at Moscow, and in 1868 they drew up and presented to the diet at Prague a
  "declaration" which has since been regarded as the official statement of
  their claims. They asked for the full restoration of the Bohemian
  kingdom; they contended that no foreign assembly was qualified to impose
  taxes in Bohemia; that the diet was not qualified to elect
  representatives to go to Vienna, and that a separate settlement must be
  made with Bohemia similar to that with Hungary. This declaration was
  signed by eighty-one members, including many of the feudal nobles and
  bishops.<a name="FnAnchor_0215" href="#Footnote_0215"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
  The German majority declared that they had forfeited their seats, and
  ordered new elections. The agitation spread over the country, serious
  riots took place, and with a view to keeping order the government decreed
  exceptional laws. Similar events happened in Moravia, and in Dalmatia the
  revolt broke out among the Bocchesi.</p>

  <p>Before the combination of Clericals and Federalists the <span
  class="sidenote">Parliamentary breakdown of 1870.</span> ministry broke
  down; they were divided among themselves; Counts Taaffe and Alfred
  Potocki, the minister of agriculture, wished to conciliate the Slav
  races&mdash;a policy recommended by Beust, probably with the sympathy of
  the emperor; the others determined to cripple the opposition by taking
  away the elections for the Reichsrath from the diets. Taaffe and his
  friends resigned in January 1870, but the majority did not long survive.
  In March, after long delay, the new Galician demands were definitely
  rejected; the whole of the Polish club, followed by the Tirolese and
  Slovenes, left the House, which consequently consisted of 110
  members&mdash;the Germans and German representatives from Bohemia and
  Moravia. It was clearly impossible to govern with such a parliament. Not
  four years had gone by, and the new constitution seemed to have failed
  like the old one. The only thing to do was to attempt a reconciliation
  with the Slavs. The ministry resigned, and Potocki and Taaffe formed a
  government with this object. Potocki, now minister-president, then
  entered on negotiations, hoping to persuade the Czechs to accept the
  constitution. Rieger and Thun were summoned to Vienna; he himself went to
  Prague, but after two days he had to give up the attempt in despair.
  Feudals and Czechs all supported the declaration of 1868, and would
  accept no compromise, and he returned to Vienna after what was the
  greatest disappointment of his life. Government, however, had to be
  carried on; the war between Germany and France broke out in July, and
  Austria might be drawn into it; the emperor could not at such a crisis
  alienate either the Germans or the Slavs. The Reichsrath and all the
  diets were dissolved. This time in Bohemia the Czechs, supported by the
  Feudals and the Clericals, gained a large majority; they took their seats
  in the diet only to declare that they did not regard it as the legal
  representative of the Bohemian kingdom, but merely an informal assembly,
  and refused to elect delegates for the Reichsrath. The Germans in their
  turn now left the diet, and the Czechs voted an address to the crown,
  drawn up by Count Thun, demanding the restoration of the Bohemian
  kingdom. When the Reichsrath met there were present only 130 out of 203
  members, for the whole Bohemian contingent was absent; the government
  then, under a law of 1868, ordered that as the Bohemian diet had sent no
  delegates, they were to be chosen directly from the people. Twenty-four
  Constitutionalists and thirty <i>Declaranten</i> were chosen; the latter,
  of course, did not go to Vienna, but the additional twenty-four made a
  working majority by which the government was carried on for the rest of
  the year.</p>

  <p>But Potocki's influence was gone, and as soon as the European <span
  class="sidenote">The ministry of Hohenwart.</span> crisis was over, in
  February 1871, the emperor appointed a ministry chosen not from the
  Liberals but from the Federalists and Clericals, led by Count Hohenwart
  and A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;F. Schäffle, a professor at the university of Vienna, chiefly
  known for his writings on political economy. They attempted to solve the
  problem by granting to the Federalists all their demands. So long as
  parliament was sitting they were kept in check; as soon as it had voted
  supplies and the Delegations had separated, they ordered new elections in
  all those diets where there was a Liberal majority. By the help of the
  Clericals they won enough seats to put the Liberals in a minority in the
  Reichsrath, and it would be possible to revise the constitution if the
  Czechs consented to come. They would only attend, however, on their own
  terms, which were a complete recognition by the government of the claims
  made in the Declaration. This was agreed to; and on the 12th of September
  at the opening of the diet, the governor read a royal message recognizing
  the separate existence of the Bohemian kingdom, and promising that the
  emperor should be crowned as king at Prague. It was received with delight
  throughout Bohemia, and the Czechs drew a draft constitution of
  fundamental rights. On this the Germans, now that they were in a
  minority, left the diet, and began preparations for resistance. In Upper
  Austria, Moravia and Carinthia, where they were outvoted by the
  Clericals, they seceded, and the whole work of 1867 was on the point of
  being overthrown. Were the movement not stopped the constitution would be
  superseded, and the union with Hungary endangered. Beust and Andrássy
  warned the emperor of the danger, and the crown prince of Saxony was
  summoned <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[v.03
  p.0030]</span>by Beust to remonstrate with him. A great council was
  called at Vienna (October 20), at which the emperor gave his decision
  that the Bohemian demands could not be accepted. The Czechs must come to
  Vienna, and consider a revision of the constitution in a constitutional
  manner. Hohenwart resigned, but at the same time Beust was dismissed, and
  a new cabinet was chosen once more from among the German Liberals, under
  the leadership of Prince Adolf Auersperg, whose brother Carlos had been
  one of the chief members in the Bürger Ministerium. For the second time
  in four years the policy of the government had completely changed within
  a few months. On 12th September the decree had been published accepting
  the Bohemian claims; before the end of the year copies of it were seized
  by the police, and men were thrown into prison for circulating it.</p>

  <p>Auersperg's ministry held office for eight years. They began <span
  class="sidenote">Auersperg's ministry, 1871 to 1879.</span> as had the
  Bürger Ministerium, with a vigorous Liberal centralizing policy. In
  Bohemia they succeeded at first in almost crushing the opposition. In
  1872 the diet was dissolved; and the whole influence of the government
  was used to procure a German majority. Koller, the governor, acted with
  great vigour. Opposition newspapers were suppressed; cases in which Czech
  journalists were concerned were transferred to the German districts, so
  that they were tried by a hostile German jury. Czech manifestoes were
  confiscated, and meetings stopped at the slightest appearance of
  disorder; and the riots were punished by quartering soldiers upon the
  inhabitants. The decision between the two races turned on the vote of the
  feudal proprietors, and in order to win this a society was formed among
  the German capitalists of Vienna (to which the name of <i>Chabrus</i> was
  popularly given) to acquire by real or fictitious purchase portions of
  those estates to which a vote was attached. These measures were
  successful; a large German majority was secured; Jews from Vienna sat in
  the place of the Thuns and the Schwarzenbergs; and as for many years the
  Czechs refused to sit in the diet, the government could be carried on
  without difficulty. A still greater blow to the Federalists was the
  passing of a new electoral law in 1873. The measure transferred the right
  of electing members of the Reichsrath from the diets to the direct vote
  of the people, the result being to deprive the Federalists of their chief
  weapon; it was no longer possible to take a formal vote of the legal
  representatives in any territory refusing to appoint deputies, and if a
  Czech or Slovene member did not take his seat the only result was that a
  single constituency was unrepresented, and the opposition weakened. The
  measure was strongly opposed. A petition with 250,000 names was presented
  from Bohemia; and the Poles withdrew from the Reichsrath when the law was
  introduced. But enough members remained to give the legal quorum, and it
  was carried by 120 to 2 votes. At the same time the number of members was
  increased to 353, but the proportion of representatives from the
  different territories was maintained and the system of election was not
  altered. The proportion of members assigned to the towns was increased,
  the special representatives of the chambers of commerce and of the landed
  proprietors were retained, and the suffrage was not extended. The
  artificial system which gave to the Germans a parliamentary majority
  continued.</p>

  <p>At this time the Czechs were much weakened by quarrels <span
  class="sidenote">Czech dissensions.</span> among themselves. A new party
  had arisen, calling themselves Radicals, but generally known as the Young
  Czechs. They disliked the alliance with the aristocracy and the clergy;
  they wished for universal suffrage, and recalled the Hussite traditions.
  They desired to take their seats in the diet, and to join with the
  Germans in political reform. They violently attacked Rieger, the leader
  of the Old Czechs, who maintained the alliance with the Feudalists and
  the policy of passive opposition. Twenty-seven members of the diet led by
  Gregr and Stadkowsky, being outvoted in the Czech Club, resigned their
  seats. They were completely defeated in the elections which followed, but
  for the next four years the two parties among the Czechs were as much
  occupied in opposing one another as in opposing the Germans. These events
  might have secured the predominance of the Liberals for many years. The
  election after the reform bill gave them an increased majority in the
  Reichsrath. Forty-two Czechs who had won seats did not attend;
  forty-three Poles stood aloof from all party combination, giving their
  votes on each occasion as the interest of their country seemed to
  require; the real opposition was limited to forty Clericals and
  representatives of the other Slav races, who were collected on the Right
  under the leadership of Hohenwart. Against them were 227
  Constitutionalists, and it seemed to matter little that they were divided
  into three groups; there were 105 in the Liberal Club under the
  leadership of Herbst, 57 Constitutionalists, elected by the landed
  proprietors, and a third body of Radicals, some of whom were more
  democratic than the old Constitutional party, while others laid more
  stress on nationality. They used their majority to carry a number of
  important laws regarding ecclesiastical affairs. Yet within four years
  the government was obliged to turn for support to the Federalists and
  Clericals, and the rule of the German Liberals was overthrown. <span
  class="sidenote">Financial crisis of 1873.</span> Their influence was
  indirectly affected by the great commercial crisis of 1873. For some
  years there had been active speculations on the Stock Exchange; a great
  number of companies, chiefly banks and building societies, had been
  founded on a very insecure basis. The inevitable crisis began in 1872; it
  was postponed for a short time, and there was some hope that the
  Exhibition, fixed for 1873, would bring fresh prosperity; the hope was
  not, however, fulfilled, and the final crash, which occurred in May,
  brought with it the collapse of hundreds of undertakings. The loss fell
  almost entirely on those who had attempted to increase their wealth by
  speculative investment. Sound industrial concerns were little touched by
  it, but speculation had become so general that every class of society was
  affected, and in the investigation which followed it became apparent that
  some of the most distinguished members of the governing Liberal party,
  including at least two members of the government, were among those who
  had profited by the unsound finance. It appeared also that many of the
  leading newspapers of Vienna, by which the Liberal party was supported,
  had received money from financiers. For the next two years political
  interest was transferred from parliament to the law courts, in which
  financial scandals were exposed, and the reputations of some of the
  leading politicians were destroyed.<a name="FnAnchor_0216"
  href="#Footnote_0216"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This was to bring about a reaction against the economic <span
  class="sidenote">Fall of the Liberal ministry.</span> doctrines which had
  held the field for nearly twenty years; but the full effect of the change
  was not seen for some time. What ruined the government was the want of
  unity in the party, and their neglect to support a ministry which had
  been taken from their own ranks. In a country like Austria, in which a
  mistaken foreign policy or a serious quarrel with Hungary might bring
  about the disruption of the monarchy, parliamentary government was
  impossible unless the party which the government helped in internal
  matters were prepared to support it in foreign affairs and in the
  commercial policy bound up with the settlement with Hungary. This the
  constitutional parties did not do. During discussions on the economic
  arrangement with Hungary in 1877 a large number voted against the duties
  on coffee and petroleum, which were an essential part of the agreement;
  they demanded, moreover, that the treaty of Berlin should be laid before
  the House, and 112 members, led by Herbst, gave a vote hostile to some of
  its provisions, and in the Delegation refused the supplies necessary for
  the occupation of Bosnia. They doubtless were acting in accordance with
  their principles, but the situation was such that it would have been
  impossible to carry out their wishes; the only result was that the
  Austrian ministers and Andrássy had to turn for help to the Poles, who
  began to acquire the position of a government party, which they have kept
  since then. At the beginning of 1870 Auersperg's resignation, which had
  long been offered, was accepted. The constitutionalists remained <!--
  Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>[v.03
  p.0031]</span>in power; but in the reconstructed cabinet, though Stremayr
  was president, Count Taaffe, as minister of the interior, was the most
  important member.</p>

  <p>Parliament was dissolved in the summer, and Taaffe, by private
  negotiations, first of all persuaded the Bohemian feudal proprietors to
  give the Feudalists, who had long been excluded, a certain number of
  seats; secondly, he succeeded where Potocki had failed, and came to an
  agreement with the Czechs; they had already, in 1878, taken their seats
  in the diet at Prague, and now gave up the policy of "passive
  resistance," and consented to take their seats also in the parliament at
  Vienna.</p>

  <p>On entering the House they took the oath without reservation, <span
  class="sidenote">Count Taaffe.</span> but in the speech from the throne
  the emperor himself stated that they had entered without prejudice to
  their convictions, and on the first day of the session Rieger read a
  formal reservation of right. The Liberals had also lost many seats, so
  that the House now had a completely different aspect; the
  constitutionalists were reduced to 91 Liberals and 54 Radicals; but the
  Right, under Hohenwart, had increased to 57, and there were 57 Poles and
  54 Czechs. A combination of these three parties might govern against the
  constitutionalists. Taaffe, who now became first minister, tried first of
  all to govern by the help of the moderates of all parties, and he
  included representatives of nearly every party in his cabinet. But the
  Liberals again voted against the government on an important military
  bill, an offence almost as unpardonable in Austria as in Germany, and a
  great meeting of the party decided that they would not support the
  government. Taaffe, therefore, was obliged to turn for support to the
  Right. The German members of the government resigned, their place was
  taken by Clericals, Poles and Czechs, Smolka was elected president of the
  Lower House of the Reichsrath, and the German Liberals found themselves
  in a minority opposed by the "iron ring" of these three parties, and
  helpless in the parliament of their own creation. For fourteen years
  Taaffe succeeded in maintaining the position he had thus secured. He was
  not himself a party man; he had sat in a Liberal government; he had never
  assented to the principles of the Federalists, nor was he an adherent of
  the Clerical party. He continued to rule according to the constitution;
  his watchword was "unpolitical politics," and he brought in little
  contentious legislation. The great source of his strength was that he
  stood between the Right and a Liberal government. There was a large
  minority of constitutionalists; they might easily become a majority, and
  the Right were therefore obliged to support Taaffe in order to avert
  this. They continued to support him, even if they did not get from him
  all that they could have wished, and the Czechs acquiesced in a foreign
  policy with which they had little sympathy. Something, however, had to be
  done for them, and from time to time concessions had to be made to the
  Clericals and the Federalists.</p>

  <p>The real desire of the Clericals was an alteration of the school <span
  class="sidenote">The Clericals.</span> law, by which the control of the
  schools should be restored to the Church and the period of compulsory
  education reduced. In this, however, the government did not meet them,
  and in 1882 the Clericals, under Prince Alfred v. Liechtenstein,
  separated from Hohenwart's party and founded their own club, so that they
  could act more freely. Both the new Clerical Club and the remainder of
  the Conservatives were much affected by the reaction against the
  doctrines of economic Liberalism. They began to adopt the principles of
  Christian Socialism expounded by Rudolf Mayer and Baron von Vogelfang,
  and the economic revolt against the influence of capital was with them
  joined to a half-religious attack upon the Jews. They represented that
  Austria was being governed by a close ring of political financiers, many
  of whom were Jews or in the pay of the Jews, who used the forms of the
  constitution, under which there was no representation of the working
  classes, to exploit the labour of the poor at the same time that they
  ruined the people by alienating them from Christianity in "godless
  schools." It was during these years that the foundation for the
  democratic clericalism of the future was laid. The chief political leader
  in this new tendency was Prince Aloys v. Liechtenstein, who complained of
  the political influence exercised by the chambers of commerce, and
  demanded the organization of working men in gilds. It was by their
  influence that a law was introduced limiting the rate of interest, and
  they co-operated with the government in legislation for improving the
  material condition of the people, which had been neglected during the
  period of Liberal government, and which was partly similar to the laws
  introduced at the same time in Germany.</p>

  <p>There seems no doubt that the condition of the workmen in the <span
  class="sidenote">Special legislation.</span> factories of Moravia and the
  oil-mines of Galicia was peculiarly unfortunate; the hours of work were
  very long, the conditions were very injurious to health, and there were
  no precautions against accidents. The report of a parliamentary inquiry,
  called for by the Christian Socialists, showed the necessity for
  interference. In 1883 a law was carried, introducing factory inspection,
  extending to mines and all industrial undertakings. The measure seems to
  have been successful, and there is a general agreement that the
  inspectors have done their work with skill and courage. In 1884 and 1885
  important laws were passed regulating the work in mines and factories,
  and introducing a maximum working day of eleven hours in factories, and
  ten hours in mines. Sunday labour was forbidden, and the hours during
  which women and children could be employed were limited. Great power was
  given to the administrative authorities to relax the application of these
  laws in special cases and special trades. This power was at first freely
  used, but it was closely restricted by a further law of 1893. In
  1887-1888 laws, modelled on the new German laws, introduced compulsory
  insurance against accidents and sickness. These measures, though severely
  criticized by the Opposition, were introduced to remedy obvious, and in
  some cases terrible social evils. Other laws to restore gilds among
  working men had a more direct political object. Another form of state
  socialism was the acquisition of railways by the state. Originally
  railways had been built by private enterprise, supported in some cases by
  a state guarantee; a law of 1877 permitted the acquisition of private
  lines; when Taaffe retired the state possessed nearly 5000 m. of railway,
  not including those which belonged to Austria and Hungary conjointly. In
  1889 a minister of railways was appointed. In this policy military
  considerations as well as economic were of influence. In every department
  we find the same reaction against the doctrines of <i>laissez-faire</i>.
  In 1889 for the first time the Austrian budget showed a surplus, partly
  the result of the new import duties, partly due to a reform of
  taxation.</p>

  <p>For a fuller description of these social reforms, see the <i>Jahrbuch
  fur Gesetzgebung</i> (Leipzig, 1886, 1888 and 1894); also the annual
  summary of new laws in the <i>Zeitschrift fur Staatswissenschaft</i>
  (Stuttgart). For the Christian Socialists, see Nitti, <i>Catholic
  Socialism</i> (London, 1895).</p>

  <p>Meanwhile it was necessary for the government to do something <span
  class="sidenote">The language question.</span> for the Czechs and the
  other Slavs, on whose support they depended for their majority. The
  influence of the government became more favourable to them in the matter
  of language, and this caused the struggle of nationalities to assume the
  first place in Austrian public life&mdash;a place which it has ever since
  maintained. The question of language becomes a political one, so far as
  it concerns the use of different languages in the public offices and law
  courts, and in the schools. There never was any general law laying down
  clear and universal rules, but since the time of Joseph II. German had
  been the ordinary language of the government. All laws were published in
  German; German was the sole language used in the central public offices
  in Vienna, and the language of the court and of the army; moreover, in
  almost every part of the monarchy it had become the language of what is
  called the <i>internal service</i> in the public offices and law courts;
  all books and correspondence were kept in German, not only in the German
  districts, but also in countries such as Bohemia and Galicia. The
  bureaucracy and the law courts had therefore become a network of
  German-speaking officialism extending over the whole country; no one had
  any share in the government <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>[v.03 p.0032]</span>unless he could speak and write
  German. The only exception was in the Italian districts; not only in
  Italy itself (in Lombardy, and afterwards in Venetia), but in South
  Tirol, Trieste, Istria and Dalmatia, Italian has always been used, even
  for the internal service of the government offices, and though the actual
  words of command are now given in German and the officers are obliged to
  know Serbo-Croatian it remains to this day the language of the Austrian
  navy. Any interference with the use of German would be a serious blow to
  the cause of those who hoped to Germanize the whole empire. Since 1867
  the old rules have been maintained absolutely as regards the army, and
  German has also, as required by the military authorities, become the
  language of the railway administration. It remains the language of the
  central offices in Vienna, and is the usual, though not the only,
  language used in the Reichsrath. In 1869 a great innovation was made,
  when Polish was introduced throughout the whole of Galicia as the normal
  language of government; and since that time the use of German has almost
  entirely disappeared in that territory. Similar innovations have also
  begun, as we shall see, in other parts.</p>

  <p>Different from this is what is called the <i>external service</i>.
  Even in the old days it was customary to use the language of the district
  in communication between the government offices and private individuals,
  and evidence could be given in the law courts in the language generally
  spoken. This was not the result of any law, but depended on
  administrative regulations of the government service; it was practically
  necessary in remote districts, such as Galicia and Bukovina, where few of
  the population understood German. In some places a Slav-speaking
  individual would himself have to provide the interpreter, and approach
  the government in German. Local authorities, <i>e.g.</i> town councils
  and the diets, were free to use what language they wished, and in this
  matter the Austrian government has shown great liberality. The
  constitution of 1867 laid down a principle of much importance, by which
  previous custom became established as a right. Article 19 runs: "All
  races of the empire have equal rights, and every race has an inviolable
  right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language.
  The equality of all customary (<i>landesüblich</i>) languages in school,
  office and public life, is recognized by the state. In those territories
  in which several races dwell, the public and educational institutions are
  to be so arranged that, without applying compulsion to learn a second
  <i>Landessprache</i>, each of the races receives the necessary means of
  education in its own language." The application of this law gives great
  power to the government, for everything depends on what is meant by
  <i>landesüblich</i>, and it rests with them to determine when a language
  is customary. The Germans demand the recognition of German as a customary
  language in every part of the empire, so that a German may claim to have
  his business attended to in his own language, even in Dalmatia and
  Galicia. In Bohemia the Czechs claim that their language shall be
  recognized as customary, even in those districts such as Reichenberg,
  which are almost completely German; the Germans, on the other hand, claim
  that the Czech language shall only be recognized in those towns and
  districts where there is a considerable Czech population. What Taaffe's
  Administration did was to interpret this law in a sense more favourable
  to the Slavs than had hitherto been the case.</p>

  <p>Peculiar importance is attached to the question of education. The law
  of 1867 required that the education in the elementary schools in the Slav
  districts should be given in Czech or Slovenian, as the case might be.
  The Slavs, however, required that, even when a small minority of Slav
  race settled in any town, they should not be compelled to go to the
  German schools, but should have their own school provided for them; and
  this demand was granted by Prazak, minister of education under Count
  Taaffe. The Germans had always hoped that the people as they became
  educated would cease to use their own particular language. Owing to
  economic causes the Slavs, who increase more rapidly than the Germans,
  tend to move westwards, and large numbers settle in the towns and
  manufacturing districts. It might have been expected that they would then
  cease to use their own language and become Germanized; but, on the
  contrary, the movement of population is spreading their language and they
  claim that special schools should be provided for them, and that men of
  their own nationality should be appointed to government offices to deal
  with their business. This has happened not only in many places in
  Bohemia, but in Styria, and even in Vienna, where there has been a great
  increase in the Czech population and a Czech school has been founded. The
  introduction of Slavonic into the middle and higher schools has affected
  the Germans in their most sensitive point. They have always insisted that
  German is the <i>Kultur-sprache</i>. On one occasion Count A. Auersperg
  (Anastasius Grün) entered the diet of Carniola carrying the whole of the
  Slovenian literature under his arm, as evidence that the Slovenian
  language could not well be substituted for German as a medium of higher
  education.</p>

  <p>The first important regulations which were issued under the law of
  1867 applied to Dalmatia, and for that country between 1872 and 1876 a
  series of laws and edicts were issued determining to what extent the
  Slavonic idioms were to be recognized. Hitherto all business had been
  done in Italian, the language of a small minority living in the seaport
  towns. The effect of these laws has been to raise Croatian to equality
  with Italian. It has been introduced in all schools, so that nearly all
  education is given in Croatian, even though a knowledge of Italian is
  quite essential for the maritime population; and it is only in one or two
  towns, such as Zara, the ancient capital of the country, that Italian is
  able to maintain itself. Since 1882 there has been a Slav majority in the
  diet, and Italian has been disused in the proceedings of that body. In
  this case the concessions to the Servo-Croatians had been made by the
  Liberal ministry; they required the parliamentary support of the
  Dalmatian representatives, who were more numerous than the Italian, and
  it was also necessary to cultivate the loyalty of the Slav races in this
  part so as to gain a support for Austria against the Russian party, which
  was very active in the Balkan Peninsula. It was better to sacrifice the
  Italians of Dalmatia than the Germans of Carinthia.<a
  name="FnAnchor_0217" href="#Footnote_0217"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It was not till 1879 that the Slovenes received the support of the
  government. In Carniola they succeeded, in 1882, in winning a majority in
  the diet, and from this time, while the diet of Styria is the centre of
  the German, that of Carniola is the chief support of the Slovene
  agitation. In the same year they won the majority in the town council of
  Laibach, which had hitherto been German. They were able, therefore, to
  introduce Illyrian as the official language, and cause the names of the
  streets to be written up in Illyrian. This question of street names is,
  as it were, a sign of victory. Serious riots broke out in some of the
  towns of Istria when, for the first time, Illyrian was used for this
  purpose as well as Italian. In Prague the victory of the Czechs has been
  marked by the removal of all German street names, and the Czech town
  council even passed a by-law forbidding private individuals to have
  tablets put up with the name of the street in German. In consequence of a
  motion by the Slovene members of the Reichsrath and a resolution of the
  diet of Carniola, the government also declared Slovenian to be a
  recognized language for the whole of Carniola, for the district of Cilli
  in Styria, and for the Slovene and mixed districts in the south of
  Carinthia, and determined that in Laibach a Slovene gymnasium should be
  maintained as well as the German one.</p>

  <p>The Germans complain that in many cases the government acted very
  unfairly to them. They constantly refer to the case of Klagenfurt. This
  town in Carinthia had a population of 16,491 German-speaking Austrians;
  the Slovenian-speaking population numbered 568, of whom 180 were
  inhabitants of the gaol or the hospital. The government, however, in 1880
  declared Slovenian a customary language, so that provision had to be made
  in public offices and law courts for dealing with business in Slovenian.
  It must be remembered, however, that even though the town was German, the
  rural population of the surrounding villages was chiefly Slovene.</p>

  <p>It was in Bohemia and Moravia that the contest was fought out with the
  greatest vehemence. The two races were nearly equal, and the victory of
  Czech would mean that nearly two <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>[v.03 p.0033]</span>million Germans would be placed in
  a position of subordination; but for the last twenty years there had been
  a constant encroachment by Czech on German. This was partly due to the
  direct action of the government. An ordinance of 1880 determined that
  henceforward all business which had been brought before any government
  office or law court should be dealt with, within the office, in the
  language in which it was introduced; this applied to the whole of Bohemia
  and Moravia, and meant that Czech would henceforward have a position
  within the government service. It was another step in the same direction
  when, in 1886, it was ordered that "to avoid frequent translations"
  business introduced in Czech should be dealt with in the same language in
  the high courts of Prague and Brünn. Then not only were a large number of
  Czech elementary schools founded, but also many middle schools were given
  to the Czechs, and Czech classes introduced in German schools; and, what
  affected the Germans most, in 1882 classes in Czech were started in the
  university of Prague&mdash;a desecration, as it seemed, of the oldest
  German university.</p>

  <p>The growth of the Slav races was, however, not merely the result of
  government assistance; it had begun long before Taaffe assumed office; it
  was to be seen in the census returns and in the results of elections.
  Prague was no longer the German city it had been fifty years before; the
  census of 1880 showed 36,000 Germans to 120,000 Czechs. It was the same
  in Pilsen. In 1861 the Germans had a majority in this town; in 1880 they
  were not a quarter of the population. This same phenomenon, which occurs
  elsewhere, cannot be attributed to any laxity of the Germans. The
  generation which was so vigorously demanding national rights had
  themselves all been brought up under the old system in German schools,
  but this had not implanted in them a desire to become German. It was
  partly due to economic causes&mdash;the greater increase among the
  Czechs, and the greater migration from the country to the towns; partly
  the result of the romantic and nationalist movement which had arisen
  about 1830, and partly the result of establishing popular education and
  parliamentary government at the same time. As soon as these races which
  had so long been ruled by the Germans received political liberty and the
  means of education, they naturally used both to reassert their national
  individuality.</p>

  <p>It may be suggested that the resistance to the German language is to
  some extent a result of the increased national feeling among the Germans
  themselves. They have made it a matter of principle. In the old days it
  was common for the children of German parents in Bohemia to learn Czech;
  since 1867 this has ceased to be the case. It may almost be said that
  they make it a point of honour not to do so. A result of this is that, as
  educated Czechs are generally bilingual, it is easier for them to obtain
  appointments in districts where a knowledge of Czech is required, and the
  Germans, therefore, regard every order requiring the use of Czech as an
  order which excludes Germans from a certain number of posts. This
  attitude of hostility and contempt is strongest among the educated middle
  class; it is not shown to the same extent by the clergy and the
  nobles.</p>

  <p>The influence of the Church is also favourable to the Slav races, not
  so much from principle as owing to the fact that they supply more
  candidates for ordination than the Germans. There is no doubt, however,
  that the tendency among Germans has been to exalt the principle of
  nationality above religion, and to give it an absolute authority in which
  the Roman Catholic Church cannot acquiesce. In this, as in other ways,
  the Germans in Austria have been much influenced by the course of events
  in the German empire. This hostility of the Church to the German
  nationalist movement led in 1898 to an agitation against the Roman
  Catholic Church, and among the Germans of Styria and other territories
  large numbers left the Church, going over either to Protestantism or to
  Old Catholicism. This "Los von Rom" movement, which was caused by the
  continued alliance of the Clerical party with the Slav parties, is more
  of the nature of a political demonstration than of a religious
  movement.</p>

  <p>The Germans, so long accustomed to rule, now saw their old <span
  class="sidenote">German hostility.</span> ascendancy threatened, and they
  defended it with an energy that increased with each defeat. In 1880 they
  founded a great society, the <i>Deutscher Schulverein</i>, to establish
  and assist German schools. It spread over the whole of the empire; in a
  few years it numbered 100,000 members, and had an income of nearly
  300,000 gulden; no private society in Austria had ever attained so great
  a success. In the Reichsrath a motion was introduced, supported by all
  the German Liberal parties, demanding that German should be declared the
  language of state and regulating the conditions under which the other
  idioms could be recognized; it was referred to a committee from which it
  never emerged, and a bill to the same effect, introduced in 1886, met a
  similar fate. In Bohemia they demanded, as a means of protecting
  themselves against the effect of the language ordinances, that the
  country should be divided into two parts; in one German was to be the
  sole language, in the other Czech was to be recognized. A proposal to
  this effect was introduced by them in the diet at the end of 1886, but
  since 1882 the Germans had been in a minority. The Czechs, of course,
  refused even to consider it; it would have cut away the ground on which
  their whole policy was built up, namely, the indissoluble unity of the
  Bohemian kingdom, in which German and Czech should throughout be
  recognized as equal and parallel languages. It was rejected on a motion
  of Prince Karl Schwarzenberg without discussion, and on this all the
  Germans rose and left the diet, thereby imitating the action of the
  Czechs in old days when they had the majority.</p>

  <p>These events produced a great change on the character of the <span
  class="sidenote">New German parties.</span> German opposition. It became
  more and more avowedly racial; the defence of German nationality was put
  in the front of their programme. The growing national animosity added
  bitterness to political life, and destroyed the possibility of a strong
  homogeneous party on which a government might depend. The beginning of
  this movement can be traced back to the year 1870. About that time a
  party of young Germans had arisen who professed to care little for
  constitutionalism and other "legal mummies," but made the preservation
  and extension of their own nationality their sole object. As is so often
  the case in Austria, the movement began in the university of Vienna,
  where a <i>Leseverein</i> (reading club) of German students was formed as
  a point of cohesion for Germans, which had eventually to be suppressed.
  The first representative of the movement in parliament was Herr von
  Schönerer, who did not scruple to declare that the Germans looked forward
  to union with the German empire. They were strongly influenced by men
  outside Austria. Bismarck was their national hero, the anniversary of
  Sedan their political festival, and approximation to Germany was dearer
  to them than the maintenance of Austria. After 1878 a heightening of
  racial feeling began among the Radicals, and in 1881 all the German
  parties in opposition joined together in a club called the United Left,
  and in their programme put in a prominent place the defence of the
  position of the Germans as the condition for the existence of the state,
  and demanded that German should be expressly recognized as the official
  language. The younger and more ardent spirits, however, found it
  difficult to work in harmony with the older constitutional leaders. They
  complained that the party leaders were not sufficiently decisive in the
  measures for self-defence. In 1885 great festivities in honour of
  Bismarck's eightieth birthday, which had been arranged in Graz, were
  forbidden by the government, and the Germans of Styria were very
  indignant that the party did not take up the matter with sufficient
  energy. After the elections of 1885 the Left, therefore, broke up again
  into two clubs, the "German Austrian," which included the more moderate,
  and the "German," which wished to use sharper language. The German Club,
  <i>e.g.</i>, congratulated Bismarck on his measures against the Poles;
  the German Austrians refused to take cognizance of events outside Austria
  with which they had nothing to do. Even the German Club was not
  sufficiently decided for Herr von Schönerer and his friends, who broke
  off from it and founded a "National German Union." They spoke much of
  <i>Germanentum</i> and <i>Unverfälschtes Deutschtum</i>, and they
  advocated a political union with the German empire, and were strongly
  anti-Hungarian and wished to resign all control over Galicia, if by a
  closer union with Germany they could secure German supremacy in Bohemia
  and the south Slav countries. They play the same part in Austria as does
  the "pan-Germanic Union" in Germany. When in 1888 the <!-- Page 34
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>[v.03 p.0034]</span>two
  clubs, the German Austrians and the Germans, joined once more under the
  name of the "United German Left" into a new club with eighty-seven
  members, so as the better to guard against the common danger and to
  defeat the educational demands of the Clericals, the National Germans
  remained apart with seventeen members. They were also infected by the
  growing spirit of anti-Semitism. The German parties had originally been
  the party of the capitalists, and comprised a large number of Jews; this
  new German party committed itself to violent attacks upon the Jews, and
  for this reason alone any real harmony between the different branches
  would have been impossible.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the concessions about language the Czechs had,
  however, made no advance towards their real object&mdash;the recognition
  of the Bohemian kingdom. Perhaps the leaders of the party, who were now
  growing old, would have been content with the influence they had already
  attained, but they were <span class="sidenote">The agreement with
  Bohemia.</span> hard pressed at home by the Young Czechs, who were more
  impatient. When Count Thun was appointed governor of Bohemia their hopes
  ran high, for he was supposed to favour the coronation of the emperor at
  Prague. In 1890, however, instead of proceeding to the coronation as was
  expected, Taaffe attempted to bring about a reconciliation between the
  opposing parties. The influence by which his policy was directed is not
  quite clear, but the Czechs had been of recent years less easy to deal
  with, and Taaffe had never really shown any wish to alter the
  constitution; his policy always was to destroy the influence of
  parliament by playing off one party against the other, and so to win a
  clear field for the government. During the month of January conferences
  were held at Vienna, with Taaffe in the chair, to which were invited
  representatives of the three groups into which the Bohemian
  representatives were divided, the German party, the Czechs, and the
  Feudal party. After a fortnight's discussion an agreement was made on the
  basis of a separation between the German and the Czech districts, and a
  revision of the electoral law. A protocol enumerating the points agreed
  on was signed by all who had taken part in the conference, and in May
  bills were laid before the diet incorporating the chief points in the
  agreement. But they were not carried; the chief reason being that the
  Young Czechs had not been asked to take part in the conference, and did
  not consider themselves bound by its decisions; they opposed the measures
  and had recourse to obstruction, and a certain number of the Old Czechs
  gradually came over to them. Their chief ground of criticizing the
  proposed measures was that they would threaten the unity of the Bohemian
  country.<a name="FnAnchor_0218" href="#Footnote_0218"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
  At the elections in 1891 a great struggle took place between the Old and
  the Young Czechs. The latter were completely victorious; Rieger, who had
  led the party for thirty years, disappeared from the Reichsrath. The
  first result was that the proposed agreement with Bohemia came to an end.
  But the disappearance of the Old Czechs made the parliamentary situation
  very insecure. The Young Czechs could not take their place: their Radical
  and anti-clerical tendencies alarmed the Feudalists and Clericalists who
  formed so large a part of the Right; they attacked the alliance with
  Germany; they made public demonstration of their French sympathies; they
  entered into communication with other Slav races, especially the Serbs of
  Hungary and Bosnia; they demanded universal suffrage, and occasionally
  supported the German Radicals in their opposition to the Clerical
  parties, especially in educational matters; under their influence
  disorder increased in Bohemia, a secret society called the
  <i>Umladina</i> (an imitation of the Servian society of that name) was
  discovered, and stringent measures had to be taken to preserve order. The
  government therefore veered round towards the German Liberals; some of
  the ministers most obnoxious to the Germans resigned, and their places
  were taken by Germans. For two years the government seemed to waver,
  looking now to the Left, now to Hohenwart and his friends; for a time
  Taaffe really had the support of all parties except the Young Czechs.</p>

  <p>After two years he gave up his cautious policy and took a <span
  class="sidenote">Electoral reform.</span> bold move. In October 1893 he
  introduced a reform bill. Universal suffrage had long been demanded by
  the working men and the Socialists; the Young Czechs also had put it on
  their programme, and many of the Christian Socialists and anti-Semites
  desired an alteration of the franchise. Taaffe's bill, while keeping the
  <i>curiae</i> of the feudal proprietors and the chambers of commerce as
  they were, and making no change in the number of members, proposed to
  give the franchise in both towns and rural districts to every one who
  could read and write, and had resided six months in one place. This was
  opposed by the Liberals, for with the growth of socialism and
  anti-Semitism, they knew that the extension of the franchise would
  destroy their influence. On this Taaffe had probably calculated, but he
  had omitted to inquire what the other parties would do. He had not even
  consulted Hohenwart, to whose assistance he owed his long tenure of
  power. Not even the pleasure of ruining the Liberals was sufficient to
  persuade the Conservatives to vote for a measure which would transfer the
  power from the well-to-do to the indigent, and Hohenwart justly
  complained that they ought to have been secure against surprises of this
  kind. The Poles also were against a measure which would give more
  influence to the Ruthenes. The position of the government was hopeless,
  and without waiting for a division Taaffe resigned.</p>

  <p>The event to which for fourteen years the Left had looked <span
  class="sidenote">The coalition ministry, 1893.</span> forward had now
  happened. Once more they could have a share in the government, which they
  always believed belonged to them by nature. Taught by experience and
  adversity, they did not scruple to enter into an alliance with their old
  enemies, and a coalition ministry was formed from the Left, the Clericals
  and the Poles. The president was Prince Alfred Windisch-Grätz, grandson
  of the celebrated general, one of Hohenwart's ablest lieutenants;
  Hohenwart himself did not take office. Of course an administration of
  this kind could not take a definite line on any controversial question,
  but during 1894 they carried through the commercial treaty with Russia
  and the laws for the continuance of the currency reform. The differences
  of the clubs appeared, however, in the discussions on franchise reform;
  the government, not strong enough to have a policy of its own, had
  referred the matter to a committee; for the question having once been
  raised, it was impossible not to go on with it. This would probably have
  been fatal to the coalition, but the final blow was given by a matter of
  very small importance arising from the disputes on nationality. The
  Slovenes had asked that in the gymnasium at Cilli classes in which
  instruction was given in Slovenian should be formed parallel to the
  German classes. This request caused great excitement in Styria and the
  neighbouring districts; the Styrian diet (from which the Slovene minority
  had seceded) protested. The Slovenes were, however, members of the
  Hohenwart Club, so Hohenwart and his followers supported the request,
  which was adopted by the ministry. The German Left opposed it; they were
  compelled to do so by the popular indignation in the German districts;
  and when the vote was carried against them (12th June 1895) they made it
  a question of confidence, and formally withdrew their support from the
  government, which therefore at once resigned.</p>

  <p>After a short interval the emperor appointed as minister-president
  <span class="sidenote">Badeni's ministry.</span> Count Badeni, who had
  earned a great reputation as governer of Galicia. He formed an
  administration the merit of which, as of so many others, was that it was
  to belong to no party and to have no programme. He hoped to be able to
  work in harmony with the moderate elements of the Left; his mission was
  to carry through the composition (<i>Ausgleich</i>) with Hungary; to this
  everything else must be subordinated. During 1896 he succeeded in
  carrying a franchise reform bill, which satisfied nearly all parties. All
  the old categories of members were maintained, but a fifth <i>curia</i>
  was added, in which almost any one might vote who had resided six months
  in one place and was not in domestic service; in this way seventy-two
  would be added to the existing members. This matter having been <!-- Page
  35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[v.03
  p.0035]</span>settled, parliament was dissolved. The result of the
  elections of 1897 was the return of a House so constituted as to make any
  strong government impossible. On both sides the anti-Semitic parties
  representing the extreme demagogic elements were present in considerable
  numbers. The United German Left had almost disappeared; it was
  represented only by a few members chosen by the great proprietors; in its
  place there were the three parties&mdash;the German Popular party, the
  German Nationalists, and the German Radicals&mdash;who all put questions
  of nationality first and had deserted the old standpoint of the
  constitution. Then there were the fourteen Social Democrats who had won
  their seats under the new franchise. The old party of the Right was,
  however, also broken up; side by side with forty-one Clericals there were
  twenty-eight Christian Socialists led by Dr Lueger, a man of great
  oratorical power, who had won a predominant influence in Vienna, so long
  the centre of Liberalism, and had quite eclipsed the more modest efforts
  of Prince Liechtenstein. As among the German National party, there were
  strong nationalist elements in his programme, but they were chiefly
  directed against Jews and Hungarians; Lueger had already distinguished
  himself by his violent attacks on Hungary, which had caused some
  embarrassment to the government at a time when the negotiations for the
  <i>Ausgleich</i> were in progress. Like anti-Semites elsewhere, the
  Christian Socialists were reckless and irresponsible, appealing directly
  to the passions and prejudices of the most ignorant. There were
  altogether 200 German members of the Reichsrath, but they were divided
  into eight parties, and nowhere did there seem to be the elements on
  which a government could be built up.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable result of the elections was the disappearance of
  the Liberals in Vienna. In 1879, out of 37 members returned in Lower
  Austria, 33 were Liberals, but now they were replaced to a large extent
  by the Socialists. It was impossible to maintain a strong party of
  moderate constitutionalists, on whom the government could depend, unless
  there was a large nucleus from Lower Austria. The influence of Lueger was
  very embarrassing; he had now a majority of two-thirds in the town
  council, and had been elected burgomaster. The emperor had refused to
  confirm the election; he had been re-elected, and then the emperor, in a
  personal interview, appealed to him to withdraw. He consented to do so;
  but, after the election of 1897 had given him so many followers in the
  Reichsrath, Badeni advised that his election as burgomaster should be
  confirmed. There was violent antipathy between the Christian Socialists
  and the German Nationalists, and the transference of their quarrels from
  the Viennese Council Chamber to the Reichsrath was very detrimental to
  the orderly conduct of debate.</p>

  <p>The limited suffrage had hitherto prevented socialism from <span
  class="sidenote">Socialism.</span> becoming a political force in Austria
  as it had in Germany, and the national divisions have always impeded the
  creation of a centralized socialist party. The first object of the
  working classes necessarily was the attainment of political power; in
  1867 there had been mass demonstrations and petitions to the government
  for universal suffrage. During the next years there was the beginning of
  a real socialist movement in Vienna and in Styria, where there is a
  considerable industrial population; after 1879, however, the growth of
  the party was interrupted by the introduction of anarchical doctrines.
  Most's paper, the <i>Freiheit</i>, was introduced through Switzerland,
  and had a large circulation. The anarchists, under the leadership of
  Peukert, seem to have attained considerable numbers. In 1883-1884 there
  were a number of serious strikes, collisions between the police and the
  workmen, followed by assassinations; it was a peculiarity of Austrian
  anarchists that in some cases they united robbery to murder. The
  government, which was seriously alarmed, introduced severe repressive
  measures; the leading anarchists were expelled or fled the country. In
  1887, under the leadership of Dr Adler, the socialist party began to
  revive (the party of violence having died away), and since then it has
  steadily gained in numbers; in the forefront of the political programme
  is put the demand for universal suffrage. In no country is the 1st of
  May, as the festival of Labour, celebrated so generally.</p>

  <p>Badeni after the election sent in his resignation, but the emperor
  refused to accept it, and he had, therefore, to do the best he could and
  turn for support to the other nationalities. The strongest of them were
  the fifty-nine Poles and sixty Young Czechs; he therefore attempted, as
  Taaffe had done, to come to some agreement with them. The Poles were
  always ready to support the government; among the Young Czechs the more
  moderate had already attempted to restrain the wilder spirits of the
  party, and they were quite prepared to enter into negotiations. They did
  not wish to lose the opportunity which now was open to them of winning
  influence over the administration. What they required was further
  concession as to the language in Bohemia. <span class="sidenote">The
  language ordinances of 1897.</span> In May 1897 Badeni, therefore,
  published his celebrated <i>ordinances</i>. They determined (1) that all
  correspondence and documents regarding every matter brought before the
  government officials should be conducted in the language in which it was
  first introduced. This applied to the whole of Bohemia, and meant the
  introduction of Czech into the government offices throughout the whole of
  the kingdom; (2) after 1903 no one was to be appointed to a post under
  the government in Bohemia until he had passed an examination in Czech.
  These ordinances fulfilled the worst fears of the Germans. The German
  Nationalists and Radicals declared that no business should be done till
  they were repealed and Badeni dismissed. They resorted to obstruction.
  They brought in repeated motions to impeach the ministers, and parliament
  had to be prorogued in June, although no business of any kind had been
  transacted. Badeni had not anticipated the effect his ordinances would
  have; as a Pole he had little experience in the western part of the
  empire. During the recess he tried to open negotiations, but <!-- Page 36
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[v.03 p.0036]</span>the
  Germans refused even to enter into a discussion until the ordinances had
  been withdrawn. The agitation spread throughout the country; great
  meetings were held at Eger and Aussig, which were attended by Germans
  from across the frontier, and led to serious disturbances; the
  cornflower, which had become the symbol of German nationality and union
  with Germany, was freely worn, and the language used was in many cases
  treasonable. The emperor insisted that the Reichsrath should again be
  summoned to pass the necessary measures for the agreement with Hungary;
  scenes then took place which have no parallel in parliamentary history.
  To meet the obstruction it was determined to sit at night, but this was
  unsuccessful. On one occasion Dr Lecher, one of the representatives of
  Moravia, spoke for twelve hours, from 9 <span class="scac">P.M.</span>
  till 9 <span class="scac">A.M.</span>, against the Ausgleich. The
  opposition was not always limited to feats of endurance of this kind. On
  the 3rd of November there was a free fight in the House; it arose from a
  quarrel between Dr Lueger and the Christian Socialists on the one side
  (for the Christian Socialists had supported the government since the
  confirmation of Lueger as burgomaster) and the German Nationalists under
  Herr Wolf, a German from Bohemia, the violence of whose language had
  already caused Badeni to challenge him to a duel. The Nationalists
  refused to allow Lueger to speak, clapping their desks, hissing and
  making other noises, till at last the Young Czechs attempted to prevent
  the disorder by violence. On the 24th of November the scenes of
  disturbance were renewed. The president, Herr v. Abrahamovitch, an
  Armenian from Galicia, refused to call on Schönerer to speak. The
  Nationalists therefore stormed the platform, and the president and
  ministers had to fly into their private rooms to escape personal
  violence, until the Czechs came to their rescue, and by superiority in
  numbers and physical strength severely punished Herr Wolf and his
  friends. The rules of the House giving the president no authority for
  maintaining order, he determined, with the assent of the ministers, to
  propose alterations in procedure. The next day, when the sitting began,
  one of the ministers, Count Falkenhayn, a Clerical who was very
  unpopular, moved "That any member who continued to disturb a sitting
  after being twice called to order could be suspended&mdash;for three days
  by the president, and for thirty days by the House." The din and uproar
  was such that not a word could be heard, but at a pre-arranged signal
  from the president all the Right rose, and he then declared that the new
  order had been carried, although the procedure of the House required that
  it should be submitted to a committee. The next day, at the beginning of
  the sitting, the Socialists rushed on the platform, tore up and destroyed
  all the papers lying there, seized the president, and held him against
  the wall. After he had escaped, eighty police were introduced into the
  House and carried out the fourteen Socialists. The next day Herr Wolf was
  treated in the same manner. The excitement spread to the street. Serious
  disorders took place in Vienna and in Graz; the German opposition had the
  support of the people, and Lueger warned the ministers that as
  burgomaster he would be unable to maintain order in Vienna; even the
  Clerical Germans showed signs of deserting the government. <span
  class="sidenote">Badeni resigns.</span> The emperor, hastily summoned to
  Vienna, accepted Badeni's resignation, the Germans having thus by
  obstruction attained part of their wishes. The new minister, Gautsch, a
  man popular with all parties, held office for three months; he proclaimed
  the budget and the Ausgleich, and in February replaced the language
  ordinances by others, under which Bohemia was to be divided into three
  districts&mdash;one Czech, one German and one mixed. The Germans,
  however, were not satisfied with this; they demanded absolute repeal. The
  Czechs also were offended; they arranged riots at Prague; the professors
  in the university refused to lecture unless the German students were
  defended from violence; Gautsch resigned, and Thun, who had been governor
  of Bohemia, was appointed minister. Martial law was proclaimed in
  Bohemia, and strictly enforced. Thun then arranged with the Hungarian
  ministers a compromise about the Ausgleich.</p>

  <p>The Reichsrath was again summoned, and the meetings were <span
  class="sidenote">Renewed conflict between Germans and Czechs.</span> less
  disturbed than in the former year, but the Germans still prevented any
  business from being done. The Germans now had a new cause of complaint.
  Paragraph 14 of the Constitutional law of 1867 provided that, in cases of
  pressing necessity, orders for which the assent of the Reichsrath was
  required might, if the Reichsrath were not in session, be proclaimed by
  the emperor; they had to be signed by the whole ministry, and if they
  were not laid before the Reichsrath within four months of its meeting, or
  if they did not receive the approval of both Houses, they ceased to be
  valid. The Germans contended that the application of this clause to the
  Ausgleich was invalid, and demanded that it should be repealed. Thun had
  in consequence to retire, in September 1899. His successor, Count Clary,
  began by withdrawing the ordinances which had been the cause of so much
  trouble, but it was now too late to restore peace. The Germans were not
  sufficiently strong and united to keep in power a minister who had
  brought them the relief for which they had been clamouring for two years.
  The Czechs, of course, went into opposition, and used obstruction. The
  extreme German party, however, took the occasion to demand that paragraph
  14 should be repealed. Clary explained that this was impossible, but he
  gave a formal pledge that he would not use it. The Czechs, however,
  prevented him passing a law on excise which was a necessary part of the
  agreements with Hungary; it was, therefore, impossible for him to carry
  on the government without breaking his word; there was nothing left for
  him to do but to resign, after holding office for less than three months.
  The emperor then appointed a ministry of officials, who were not bound by
  his pledge, and used paragraph 14 for the necessary purposes of state.
  They then made way for a ministry under Herr v. Körber. During the early
  months of 1900 matters were more peaceful, and Körber hoped to be able to
  arrange a compromise; but the Czechs now demanded the restoration of
  their language in the internal service of Bohemia, and on 8th June, by
  noise and disturbance, obliged the president to suspend the sitting. The
  Reichsrath was immediately dissolved, the emperor having determined to
  make a final attempt to get together a parliament with which it would be
  possible to govern. The new elections on which so much was to depend did
  not take place till January 1901. They resulted in a great increase of
  the extreme German Nationalist parties. Schönerer and the German
  Radicals&mdash;the fanatical German party who in their new programme
  advocated union of German Austria with the German empire&mdash;now
  numbered twenty-one, who chiefly came from Bohemia. They were able for
  the first time to procure the election of one of their party in the
  Austrian Delegation, and threatened to introduce into the Assembly scenes
  of disorder similar to those which they had made common in the
  Reichsrath. All those parties which did not primarily appeal to national
  feeling suffered loss; especially was this the case with the two sections
  of the Clericals, the Christian Socialists and the Ultramontanes; and the
  increasing enmity between the German Nationalists (who refused even the
  name German to a Roman Catholic) and the Church became one of the most
  conspicuous features in the political situation. The loss of seats by the
  Socialists showed that even among the working men the national agitation
  was gaining ground; the diminished influence of the anti-Semites was the
  most encouraging sign.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the result of the elections, the first months of the
  new parliament passed in comparative peace. There was a truce between the
  nationalities. The Germans were more occupied with their opposition to
  the Clericals than with their feud with the Slavs. The Czechs refrained
  from obstruction, for they did not wish to forfeit the alliance with the
  Poles and Conservatives, on which their parliamentary strength depended,
  and the Germans used the opportunity to pass measures for promoting the
  material prosperity of the country, especially for an important system of
  canals which would bring additional prosperity to the coal-fields and
  manufactures of Bohemia.</p>

  <p>(<span class="sc">J. W. He.</span>)</p>

  <p>The history of Austria since the general election of 1901 is the <span
  class="sidenote">Public works policy.</span> <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[v.03 p.0037]</span>history of
  franchise reform as a crowning attempt to restore parliament to normal
  working conditions. The premier, Dr von Körber, who had undertaken to
  overcome obstruction and who hoped to effect a compromise between Germans
  and Czechs, induced the Chamber to sanction the estimates, the contingent
  of recruits and other "necessities of state" for 1901 and 1902, by
  promising to undertake large public works in which Czechs and Germans
  were alike interested. These public works were chiefly a canal from the
  Danube to the Oder; a ship canal from the Danube to the Moldau near
  Budweis, and the canalization of the Moldau from Budweis to Prague; a
  ship canal running from the projected Danube-Oder canal near Prerau to
  the Elbe near Pardubitz, and the canalization of the Elbe from Pardubitz
  to Melnik; a navigable connexion between the Danube-Oder Canal and the
  Vistula and the Dniester. It was estimated that the construction of these
  four canals would require twenty years, the funds being furnished by a 4%
  loan amortizable in ninety years. In addition to the canals, the cabinet
  proposed and the Chamber sanctioned the construction of a "second railway
  route to Trieste" designed to shorten the distance between South Germany,
  Salzburg and the Adriatic, by means of a line passing under the Alpine
  ranges of central and southern Austria. The principal sections of this
  line were named after the ranges they pierced, the chief tunnels being
  bored through the Tauern, Karawanken and Wochein hills. Sections were to
  be thrown open to traffic as soon as completed and the whole work to be
  ended during 1909. The line forms one of the most interesting railway
  routes in Europe. The cost, however, greatly exceeded the estimate
  sanctioned by parliament; and the contention that the parliamentary
  adoption of the Budget in 1901-1902 cost the state £100,000,000 for
  public works, is not entirely unfounded. True, these works were in most
  cases desirable and in some cases necessary, but they were hastily
  promised and often hastily begun under pressure of political expediency.
  The Körber administration was for this reason subsequently exposed to
  severe censure.</p>

  <p>Despite these public works Dr von Körber found himself <span
  class="sidenote">Körber's parliamentary difficulties.</span> unable to
  induce parliament to vote the Budgets for 1903, 1904 or 1905, and was
  obliged to revert to the expedient employed by his predecessors of
  sanctioning the estimates by imperial ordinance under paragraph 14 of the
  constitution. His attempts in December 1902 and January 1903 to promote a
  compromise between Czechs and Germans proved equally futile. Körber
  proposed that Bohemia be divided into 10 districts, of which 5 would be
  Czech, 3 German and 2 mixed. Of the 234 district tribunals, 133 were to
  be Czech, 94 German and 7 mixed. The Czechs demanded on the contrary that
  both their language and German should be placed on an equal footing
  throughout Bohemia, and be used for all official purposes in the same
  way. As this demand involved the recognition of Czech as a language of
  internal service in Bohemia it was refused by the Germans. Thenceforward,
  until his fall on the 31st of December 1904, Körber governed practically
  without parliament. The Chamber was summoned at intervals rather as a
  pretext for the subsequent employment of paragraph 14 than in the hope of
  securing its assent to legislative measures. The Czechs blocked business
  by a pile of "urgency motions" and occasionally indulged in noisy
  obstruction. On one occasion a sitting lasted 57 hours without
  interruption. In consequence of Czech aggressiveness, the German parties
  (the German Progressists, the German Populists, the Constitutional Landed
  Proprietors and the Christian Socialists) created a joint executive
  committee and a supreme committee of four members to watch over German
  racial interests.</p>

  <p>By the end of 1904 it had become clear that the system of <span
  class="sidenote">Baron Gautsch premier.</span> government by paragraph
  14, which Dr von Körber had perfected was not effective in the long run.
  Loans were needed for military and other purposes, and paragraph 14
  itself declares that it cannot be employed for the contraction of any
  lasting burden upon the exchequer, nor for any sale of state patrimony.
  As the person of the premier had become so obnoxious to the Czechs that
  his removal would be regarded by them as a concession, his resignation
  was suddenly accepted by the emperor, and, on the 1st of January 1905, a
  former premier, Baron von Gautsch, was appointed in his stead.
  Parliamentary activity was at once resumed; the Austro-Hungarian tariff
  contained in the Széll-Körber compact was adopted, the estimates were
  discussed and the commercial treaty with Germany ratified. In the early
  autumn, however, a radical change came over the spirit of Austrian
  politics. For nearly three years Austria had been watching with
  bitterness and depression the course of the crisis in Hungary. Parliament
  had repeatedly expressed its disapproval of the Magyar demands upon the
  crown, but had succeeded only in demonstrating its own impotence. The
  feeling that Austria could be compelled by imperial ordinance under
  paragraph 14 to acquiesce in whatever concessions the crown might make to
  Hungary galled Austrian public opinion and prepared it for coming
  changes. In August 1905 the crown took into consideration and in
  September sanctioned the proposal that universal suffrage be introduced
  into the official programme of the Fejérváry cabinet then engaged in
  combating the Coalition in Hungary. It is not to be supposed that the
  king of Hungary assented to this programme without reflecting that what
  he sought to further in Hungary, it would be impossible for him, as
  emperor of Austria, to oppose in Cisleithania. His subsequent action
  justifies, indeed, the belief that, when sanctioning the Fejérváry
  programme, the monarch had already decided that universal suffrage should
  be introduced in Austria; but even he can scarcely have been prepared for
  the rapidity with which the movement in Austria gained ground and
  accomplished its object.</p>

  <p>On the 15th of September 1905 a huge socialist and working-class <span
  class="sidenote">Franchise reform.</span> demonstration in favour of
  universal suffrage took place before the parliament at Budapest. The
  Austrian Socialist party, encouraged by this manifestation and influenced
  by the revolutionary movement in Russia, resolved to press for franchise
  reform in Austria also. An initial demonstration, resulting in some
  bloodshed, was organized in Vienna at the beginning of November. At
  Prague, Graz and other towns, demonstrations and collisions with the
  police were frequent. The premier, Baron Gautsch, who had previously
  discountenanced universal suffrage while admitting the desirability of a
  restricted reform, then changed attitude and permitted an enormous
  Socialist demonstration, in support of universal suffrage, to take place
  (November 28) in the Vienna Ringstrasse. Traffic was suspended for five
  hours while an orderly procession of workmen, ten abreast, marched
  silently along the Ringstrasse past the houses of parliament. The
  demonstration made a deep impression upon public opinion. On the same day
  the premier promised to introduce by February a large measure of
  franchise reform so framed as to protect racial minorities from being
  overwhelmed at the polls by majorities of other races. On the 23rd of
  February 1906 he indeed brought in a series of franchise reform measures.
  Their main principles were the abolition of the <i>curia</i> or electoral
  class system and the establishment of the franchise on the basis of
  universal suffrage; and the division of Austria electorally into racial
  compartments within which each race would be assured against molestation
  from other races. The Gautsch redistribution bill proposed to increase
  the number of constituencies from 425 to 455, to allot a fixed number of
  constituencies to each province and, within each province, to each race
  according to its numbers and tax-paying capacity. The reform bill proper
  proposed to enfranchise every male citizen above 24 years of age with one
  year's residential qualification.</p>

  <p>At first the chances of the adoption of such a measure seemed small.
  It was warmly supported from outside by the Social Democrats, who held
  only 11 seats in the House; inside, the Christian Socialists or Lueger
  party were favourable on the whole as they hoped to gain seats at the
  expense of the German Progressives and German Populists and to extend
  their own organization throughout the empire. The Young Czechs, too, were
  favourable, while the Poles reserved their attitude. Hostile <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[v.03 p.0038]</span>in
  principle and by instinct, they waited to ascertain the mind of the
  emperor, before actively opposing the reform. With the exception of the
  German Populists who felt that a German "Liberal" party could not well
  oppose an extension of popular rights, all the German Liberals were
  antagonistic, some bitterly, to the measure. The Constitutional Landed
  Proprietors who had played so large a part in Austrian politics since the
  'sixties, and had for a generation held the leadership of the German
  element in parliament and in the country, saw themselves doomed and the
  leadership of the Germans given to the Christian Socialists. None of the
  representatives of the <i>curia</i> system fought so tenaciously for
  their privileges as did the German nominees of the <i>curia</i> of large
  landed proprietors. Their opposition proved unavailing. The emperor
  frowned repeatedly upon their efforts.</p>

  <p>Baron Gautsch fell in April over a difference with the Poles, and
  <span class="sidenote">Baron Beck premier.</span> his successor, Prince
  Konrad zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, who had taken over the reform bills,
  resigned also, six weeks later, as a protest against the action of the
  crown in consenting to the enactment of a customs tariff in Hungary
  distinct from, though identical with, the joint Austro-Hungarian tariff
  comprised in the Széll-Körber compact and enacted as a joint tariff by
  the Reichsrath. A new cabinet was formed (June 2) by Baron von Beck,
  permanent under secretary of state in the ministry for agriculture, an
  official of considerable ability who had first acquired prominence as an
  instructor of the heir apparent, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, in
  constitutional and administrative law. By dint of skilful negotiation
  with the various parties and races, and steadily supported by the emperor
  who, on one occasion, summoned the recalcitrant party leaders to the
  Hofburg <i>ad audiendum verbum</i> and told them the reform "must be
  accomplished," Baron Beck succeeded, in October 1906, in attaining a
  final agreement, and on the 1st of December in securing the adoption of
  the reform. During the negotiations the number of constituencies was
  raised to 516, divided, according to provinces, as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the allotment of the constituencies to the various races their
  tax-paying capacity was taken into consideration. In mixed districts
  separate constituencies and registers were established for the electors
  of each race, who could only vote on their own register for a candidate
  of their own race. Thus Germans were obliged to vote for Germans and
  Czechs for Czechs; and, though there might be victories of Clerical over
  Liberal Germans or of Czech Radicals over Young Czechs, there could be no
  victories of Czechs over Germans, Poles over Ruthenes, or Slovenes over
  Italians. The constituencies were divided according to race as

  <p>These allotments were slightly modified at the polls by the victory of
  some Social Democratic candidates not susceptible of strict racial
  classification. The chief feature of the allotment was, however, the
  formal overthrow of the fiction that Austria is preponderatingly a German
  country and not a country preponderatingly Slav with a German dynasty and
  a German façade. The German constituencies, though allotted in a
  proportion unduly favourable, left the Germans, with 233 seats, in a
  permanent minority as compared with the 259 Slav seats. Even with the
  addition of the "Latin" (Rumanian and Italian) seats the "German-Latin
  block" amounted only to 257. This "block" no longer exists in practice,
  as the Italians now tend to co-operate rather with the Slavs than with
  the Germans. The greatest gainers by the redistribution were the
  Ruthenes, whose representation was trebled, though it is still far from
  being proportioned to their numbers. This and other anomalies will
  doubtless be corrected in future revisions of the allotment, although the
  German parties, foreseeing that any revision must work out to their
  disadvantage, stipulated that a two-thirds majority should be necessary
  for any alteration of the law.</p>

  <p>After unsuccessful attempts by the Upper House to introduce <span
  class="sidenote">General election 1907.</span> plural voting, the bill
  became law in January 1907, the peers insisting only upon the
  establishment of a fixed <i>maximum</i> number or <i>numerus clausus</i>,
  of non-hereditary peers, so as to prevent the resistance of the Upper
  Chamber from being overwhelmed at any critical moment by an influx of
  crown nominees appointed <i>ad hoc</i>. The general election which took
  place amid considerable enthusiasm on the 14th of May resulted in a
  sweeping victory for the Social Democrats whose number rose from 11 to
  87; in a less complete triumph for the Christian Socialists who increased
  from 27 to 67; and in the success of the extremer over the conservative
  elements in all races. A classification of the groups in the new Chamber
  presents many difficulties, but the following statement is approximately
  accurate. It must be premised that, in order to render the Christian
  Socialist or Lueger party the strongest group in parliament, an
  amalgamation was effected between them and the conservative Catholic
  party:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The legislature elected by universal suffrage worked fairly smoothly
  during the first year of its existence. The estimates were voted with
  regularity, racial animosity was somewhat less prominent, and some large
  issues were debated. The desire not to disturb the emperor's Diamond
  Jubilee year by untoward scenes doubtless contributed to calm political
  passion, and it was celebrated in 1908 with complete success. But it was
  no sooner over than the crisis over the annexation of Bosnia and
  Herzegovina, which is dealt with above, eclipsed all purely domestic
  affairs in the larger European question.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;1. <i>Sources</i>. A
  collection of early authorities on Austrian history was published in 3
  vols. folio by Hieronymus Pez (Leipzig, 1721-1725) under the title
  <i>Scriptores rerum Austriacarum veteres et genuini</i>, of which a new
  edition was printed at Regensburg in 1745, and again, under the title of
  <i>Rerum Austriacarum scriptores</i>, by A. Rauch at Vienna in 1793-1794.
  It was not, however, till the latter half of the 19th century that the
  vast store of public and private archives began to be systematically
  exploited. Apart from the material published in the <i>Monumenta Germ.
  Hist</i>. of Pertz and his collaborators, there are several collections
  devoted specially to the sources of Austrian history. Of these the most
  notable is the <i>Fontes rerum Austriacarum</i>, published under the
  auspices of the Historical Commission of the Imperial Academy of Sciences
  at Vienna; the series, of which the first volume was published in 1855,
  is divided into two parts: (i.) <i>Scriptores</i>, of which the 9th vol.
  appeared in 1904; (ii.) <i>Diplomataria et Acta</i>, of which the 58th
  vol. appeared in 1906. It covers the whole range of Austrian history,
  medieval and modern. Another collection is the <i>Quellen und Forschungen
  zur Geschichte, Literatur und Sprache Österreichs und seiner
  Kronländer</i>, edited by J. Hirn and J.&nbsp;E. Wackernagel (Graz, 1895,
  &amp;c.), of which vol. x. appeared in 1906. Besides these there are
  numerous accounts and inventories of public and private archives, for
  which see Dahlmann-Waitz, <i>Quellenkunde</i> (ed. 1906), pp. 14-15, 43,
  and suppl. vol. (1907), pp. 4-5. Of collections of treaties the most
  notable is that of L. Neumann, <i>Recueil des traités conclus par
  l'Autriche avec les puissances étrangères depuis 1763</i> (6 vols.,
  Leipzig, 1855: c.), continued by A. de Plason (18 vols., Vienna,
  1877-1905). In 1907, however, the Imperial Commission for the Modern
  History of Austria issued the first volume of a new series,
  <i>Österreichische Staatsverträge</i>, which promises to be of the utmost
  value. Like the <i>Recueil des traités conclus par la Russie</i> of T.&nbsp;T.
  de Martens, it is compiled on the principle of devoting separate volumes
  to the treaties entered into with the several states; this is obviously
  convenient as enabling the student to obtain a clear review of the
  relations of Austria to any particular state throughout the whole period
  covered. For treaties see also J. Freiherr von Vasque von Püttlingen,
  <i>Übersicht der österreichischen Staatsverträge seit Maria Theresa bis
  auf die neueste Zeit</i> (Vienna, 1868); and L. Bittner,
  <i>Chronologisches Verzeichnis der österreichischen Staatsverträge</i>
  (Band G, 1526-1723, Vienna, 1903).</p>

  official documents as "the kingdoms and lands represented in the

  expressed their desire that the word Austria should be used, but it has
  not been gratified. On the other hand, expressions such as "Austrian
  citizens," "Austrian law" are found. The reason of this peculiar use is
  probably twofold. On the one hand, a reluctance to confess that Hungary
  is no longer in any sense a part of Austria; on the other hand, the
  refusal of the Czechs to recognize that their country is part of Austria.

  <p><b>AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION, WAR OF THE</b> (1740-1748). This war began
  with the invasion of Silesia by Frederick II. of Prussia in 1740, and was
  ended by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) in 1748. After 1741 nearly
  all the powers of Europe were involved in the struggle, but the most
  enduring interest of the war lies in the struggle of Prussia and Austria
  for Silesia. Southwest Germany, the Low Countries and Italy were, as
  usual, the battle-grounds of France and Austria. The constant allies of
  France and Prussia were Spain and Bavaria; various other powers at
  intervals joined them. The cause of Austria was supported almost as a
  matter of course by England and Holland, the traditional enemies of
  France. Of Austria's allies from time to time Sardinia and Saxony were
  the most important.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Frederick's Invasion of Silesia, 1740.</i>&mdash;Prussia in 1740
  was a small, compact and thoroughly organized power, with an army 100,000
  strong. The only recent war service of this army had been in the
  desultory Rhine campaign of 1733-35. It was therefore regarded as one of
  the minor armies of Europe, and few thought that it could rival the
  forces of Austria and France. But it was drilled to a perfection not
  hitherto attained, and the Prussian infantry soldier was so well trained
  and equipped that <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>[v.03 p.0040]</span>he could fire five shots to the
  Austrian's three, though the cavalry and artillery were less efficient.
  But the initial advantage of Frederick's army was that it had,
  undisturbed by wars, developed the standing army theory to full effect.
  While the Austrians had to wait for drafts to complete the field forces,
  Prussian regiments could take the field at once, and thus Frederick was
  able to overrun Silesia almost unopposed. His army was concentrated
  quietly upon the Oder, and without declaration of war, on the 16th of
  December 1740, it crossed the frontier into Silesia. The Austrian
  generals could do no more than garrison a few fortresses, and with the
  small remnant of their available forces fell back to the mountain
  frontier of Bohemia and Moravia. The Prussian army was soon able to go
  into winter quarters, holding all Silesia and investing the strong places
  of Glogau, Brieg and Neisse.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Silesian Campaign of 1741.</i>&mdash;In February 1741, the
  Austrians collected a field army under Count Neipperg (1684-1774) and
  made preparations to reconquer Silesia. The Austrians in Neisse and Brieg
  still held out. Glogau, however, was stormed on the night of the 9th of
  March, the Prussians, under Prince Leopold (the younger) of
  Anhalt-Dessau, executing their task in one hour with a mathematical
  precision which excited universal admiration. But the Austrian army in
  Moravia was now in the field, and Frederick's cantonments were dispersed
  over all Upper Silesia. It was a work of the greatest difficulty to
  collect the army, for the ground was deep in snow, and before it was
  completed Neisse was relieved and the Prussians cut off from their own
  country by the march of Neipperg from Neisse on Brieg; a few days of slow
  man&oelig;uvring between these places ended in the battle of Mollwitz
  (10th April 1741), the first pitched battle fought by Frederick and his
  army. The Prussian right wing of cavalry was speedily routed, but the day
  was retrieved by the magnificent discipline and tenacity of the infantry.
  The Austrian cavalry was shattered in repeated attempts to ride them
  down, and before the Prussian volleys the Austrian infantry, in spite of
  all that Neipperg and his officers could do, gradually melted away. After
  a stubborn contest the Prussians remained masters of the field. Frederick
  himself was far away. He had fought in the cavalry mêlée, but after this,
  when the battle seemed lost, he had been persuaded by Field Marshal
  Schwerin to ride away. Schwerin thus, like Marshal Saxe at Fontenoy,
  remained behind to win the victory, and the king narrowly escaped being
  captured by wandering Austrian hussars. The immediate result of the
  battle was that the king secured Brieg, and Neipperg fell back to Neisse,
  where he maintained himself and engaged in a war of man&oelig;uvre during
  the summer. But Europe realized suddenly that a new military power had
  arisen, and France sent Marshal Belleisle to Frederick's camp to
  negotiate an alliance. Thenceforward the "Silesian adventure" became the
  War of the Austrian Succession. The elector of Bavaria's candidature for
  the imperial dignity was to be supported by a French "auxiliary" army,
  and other French forces were sent to observe Hanover. Saxony was already
  watched by a Prussian army under Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau, the
  "old Dessauer," who had trained the Prussian army to its present
  perfection. The task of Sweden was to prevent Russia from attacking
  Prussia, but her troops were defeated, on the 3rd of September 1741, at
  Wilmanstrand by a greatly superior Russian army, and in 1742 another
  great reverse was sustained in the capitulation of Helsingfors. In
  central Italy an army of Neapolitans and Spaniards was collected for the
  conquest of the Milanese.</p>

  <p>3. <i>The Allies in Bohemia.</i>&mdash;The French duly joined the
  elector's forces on the Danube and advanced on Vienna; but the objective
  was suddenly changed, and after many countermarches the allies advanced,
  in three widely-separated corps, on Prague. A French corps moved via
  Amberg and Pilsen. The elector marched on Budweis, and the Saxons (who
  had now joined the allies) invaded Bohemia by the Elbe valley. The
  Austrians could at first offer little resistance, but before long a
  considerable force intervened at Tabor between the Danube and the allies,
  and Neipperg was now on the march from Neisse to join in the campaign. He
  had made with Frederick the curious agreement of Klein Schnellendorf (9th
  October 1741), by which Neisse was surrendered after a mock siege, and
  the Austrians undertook to leave Frederick unmolested in return for his
  releasing Neipperg's army for service elsewhere. At the same time the
  Hungarians, moved to enthusiasm by the personal appeal of Maria Theresa,
  had put into the field a <i>levée en masse</i>, or "insurrection," which
  furnished the regular army with an invaluable force of light troops. A
  fresh army was collected under Field Marshal Khevenhüller at Vienna, and
  the Austrians planned an offensive winter campaign against the
  Franco-Bavarian forces in Bohemia and the small Bavarian army that
  remained on the Danube to defend the electorate. The French in the
  meantime had stormed Prague on the 26th of November, the grand-duke
  Francis, consort of Maria Theresa, who commanded the Austrians in
  Bohemia, moving too slowly to save the fortress. The elector of Bavaria,
  who now styled himself archduke of Austria, was crowned king of Bohemia
  (19th December 1741) and elected to the imperial throne as Charles VII.
  (24th January 1742), but no active measures were undertaken. In Bohemia
  the month of December was occupied in mere skirmishes. On the Danube,
  Khevenhüller, the best general in the Austrian service, advanced on the
  27th of December, swiftly drove back the allies, shut them up in Linz,
  and pressed on into Bavaria. Munich itself surrendered to the Austrians
  on the coronation day of Charles VII. At the close of this first act of
  the campaign the French, under the old Marshal de Broglie, maintained a
  precarious foothold in central Bohemia, menaced by the main army of the
  Austrians, and Khevenhüller was ranging unopposed in Bavaria, while
  Frederick, in pursuance of his secret obligations, lay inactive in
  Silesia. In Italy the allied Neapolitans and Spaniards had advanced
  towards Modena, the duke of which state had allied himself with them, but
  the vigilant Austrian commander Count Traun had outmarched them, captured
  Modena, and forced the duke to make a separate peace.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Campaign of 1742.</i>&mdash;Frederick had hoped by the truce to
  secure Silesia, for which alone he was fighting. But with the successes
  of Khevenhüller and the enthusiastic "insurrection" of Hungary, Maria
  Theresa's opposition became firmer, and she divulged the provisions of
  the truce, in order to compromise Frederick with his allies. The war
  recommenced. Frederick had not rested on his laurels; in the uneventful
  summer campaign of 1741 he had found time to begin that reorganization of
  his cavalry which was before long to make it even more efficient than his
  infantry. Charles VII., whose territories were overrun by the Austrians,
  asked him to create a diversion by invading Moravia. In December 1741,
  therefore, Schwerin had crossed the border and captured Olmütz. Glatz
  also was invested, and the Prussian army was concentrated about Olmütz in
  January 1742. A combined plan of operations was made by the French,
  Saxons and Prussians for the rescue of Linz. But Linz soon fell; Broglie
  on the Moldau, weakened by the departure of the Bavarians to oppose
  Khevenhüller, and of the Saxons to join forces with Frederick, was in no
  condition to take the offensive, and large forces under Prince Charles of
  Lorraine lay in his front from Budweis to Iglau. Frederick's march was
  made towards Iglau in the first place. Brünn was invested about the same
  time (February), but the direction of the march was changed, and instead
  of moving against Prince Charles, Frederick pushed on southwards by Znaim
  and Nikolsburg. The extreme outposts of the Prussians appeared before
  Vienna. But Frederick's advance was a mere foray, and Prince Charles,
  leaving a screen of troops in front of Broglie, marched to cut off the
  Prussians from Silesia, while the Hungarian levies poured into Upper
  Silesia by the Jablunka Pass. The Saxons, discontented and demoralized,
  soon marched off to their own country, and Frederick with his Prussians
  fell back by Zwittau and Leutomischl to Kuttenberg in Bohemia, where he
  was in touch with Broglie on the one hand and (Glatz having now
  surrendered) with Silesia on the other. No defence of Olmütz was
  attempted, and the small Prussian corps remaining in Moravia fell back
  towards Upper Silesia. Prince Charles, in pursuit of the king <!-- Page
  41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[v.03
  p.0041]</span>marched by Iglau and Teutsch (Deutsch) Brod on Kuttenberg,
  and on the 17th of May was fought the battle of Chotusitz or Czaslau, in
  which after a severe struggle the king was victorious. His cavalry on
  this occasion retrieved its previous failure, and its conduct gave an
  earnest of its future glory not only by its charges on the battlefield,
  but its vigorous pursuit of the defeated Austrians. Almost at the same
  time Broglie fell upon a part of the Austrians left on the Moldau and won
  a small, but morally and politically important, success in the action of
  Sahay, near Budweis (May 24, 1742). Frederick did not propose another
  combined movement. His victory and that of Broglie disposed Maria Theresa
  to cede Silesia in order to make good her position elsewhere, and the
  separate peace between Prussia and Austria, signed at Breslau on the 11th
  of June, closed the First Silesian War. The War of the Austrian
  Succession continued.</p>

  <p>5. <i>The French at Prague.</i>&mdash;The return of Prince Charles,
  released by the peace of Breslau, put an end to Broglie's offensive. The
  prince pushed back the French posts everywhere, and his army converged
  upon Prague, where, towards the end of June 1742, the French were to all
  intents and purposes surrounded. Broglie had made the best resistance
  possible with his inferior forces, and still displayed great activity,
  but his position was one of great peril. The French government realized
  at last that it had given its general inadequate forces. The French army
  on the lower Rhine, hitherto in observation of Hanover and other possibly
  hostile states, was hurried into Franconia. Prince Charles at once raised
  the siege of Prague (September 14), called up Khevenhüller with the
  greater part of the Austrian army on the Danube, and marched towards
  Amberg to meet the new opponent. Marshal Maillebois (1682-1762), its
  commander, then man&oelig;uvred from Amberg towards the Eger valley, to
  gain touch with Broglie. Marshal Belleisle, the political head of French
  affairs in Germany and a very capable general, had accompanied Broglie
  throughout, and it seems that Belleisle and Broglie believed that
  Maillebois' mission was to regain a permanent foothold for the army in
  Bohemia; Maillebois, on the contrary, conceived that his work was simply
  to disengage the army of Broglie from its dangerous position, and to
  cover its retreat. His operations were no more than a demonstration, and
  had so little effect that Broglie was sent for in haste to take over the
  command from him, Belleisle at the same time taking over charge of the
  army at Prague. Broglie's command was now on the Danube, east of
  Regensburg, and the imperial (chiefly Bavarian) army of Charles VII.
  under Seckendorf aided him to clear Bavaria of the Austrians. This was
  effected with ease, for Khevenhüller and most of his troops had gone to
  Bohemia. Prince Charles and Khevenhüller now took post between Linz and
  Passau, leaving a strong force to deal with Belleisle in Prague. This,
  under Prince Lobkowitz, was little superior in numbers or quality to the
  troops under Belleisle, under whom served Saxe and the best of the
  younger French generals, but its light cavalry swept the country clear of
  provisions. The French were quickly on the verge of starvation, winter
  had come, and the marshal resolved to retreat. On the night of the 16th
  of December 1742, the army left Prague to be defended by a small garrison
  under Chevert, and took the route of Eger. The retreat (December 16-26)
  was accounted a triumph of generalship, but the weather made it painful
  and costly. The brave Chevert displayed such confidence that the
  Austrians were glad to allow him freedom to join the main army. The cause
  of the new emperor was now sustained only in the valley of the Danube,
  where Broglie and Seckendorf opposed Prince Charles and Khevenhüller, who
  were soon joined by the force lately opposing Belleisle.</p>

  <p>In Italy, Traun held his own with ease against the Spaniards and
  Neapolitans. Naples was forced by a British squadron to withdraw her
  troops for home defence, and Spain, now too weak to advance in the Po
  valley, sent a second army to Italy via France. Sardinia had allied
  herself with Austria, and at the same time neither state was at war with
  France, and this led to curious complications, combats being fought in
  the Isère valley between the troops of Sardinia and of Spain, in which
  the French took no part.</p>

  <p>6. <i>The Campaign of 1743</i> opened disastrously for the emperor.
  The French and Bavarian armies were not working well together, and
  Broglie and Seckendorf had actually quarrelled. No connected resistance
  was offered to the converging march of Prince Charles's army along the
  Danube, Khevenhüller from Salzburg towards southern Bavaria, and Prince
  Lobkowitz (1685-1755) from Bohemia towards the Naab. The Bavarians
  suffered a severe reverse near Braunau (May 9, 1743), and now an
  Anglo-allied army commanded by King George II., which had been formed on
  the lower Rhine on the withdrawal of Maillebois, was advancing southward
  to the Main and Neckar country. A French army, under Marshal Noailles,
  was being collected on the middle Rhine to deal with this new force. But
  Broglie was now in full retreat, and the strong places of Bavaria
  surrendered one after the other to Prince Charles. The French and
  Bavarians had been driven almost to the Rhine when Noailles and the king
  came to battle. George, completely outman&oelig;uvred by his veteran
  antagonist, was in a position of the greatest danger between
  Aschaffenburg and Hanau in the defile formed by the Spessart Hills and
  the river Main. Noailles blocked the outlet and had posts all around, but
  the allied troops forced their way through and inflicted heavy losses on
  the French, and the battle of Dettingen is justly reckoned as a notable
  victory of the British arms (June 27). Both Broglie, who, worn out by age
  and exertions, was soon replaced by Marshal Coigny (1670-1759), and
  Noailles were now on the strict defensive behind the Rhine. Not a single
  French soldier remained in Germany, and Prince Charles prepared to force
  the passage of the great river in the Breisgau while the king of England
  moved forward via Mainz to co-operate by drawing upon himself the
  attention of both the French marshals. The Anglo-allied army took Worms,
  but after several unsuccessful attempts to cross, Prince Charles went
  into winter quarters. The king followed his example, drawing in his
  troops to the northward, to deal, if necessary, with the army which the
  French were collecting on the frontier of Flanders. Austria, England,
  Holland and Sardinia were now allied. Saxony changed sides, and Sweden
  and Russia neutralized each other (peace of Abo, August 1743). Frederick
  was still quiescent; France, Spain and Bavaria alone continued actively
  the struggle against Maria Theresa.</p>

  <p>In Italy, the Spaniards on the Panaro had achieved a Pyrrhic victory
  over Traun at Campo Santo (February 8, 1743), but the next six months
  were wasted in inaction, and Lobkowitz, joining Traun with reinforcements
  from Germany, drove back the enemy to Rimini. The Spanish-Piedmontese war
  in the Alps continued without much result, the only incident of note
  being a combat at Casteldelfino won by the king of Sardinia in
  person.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Campaign of 1744.</i>&mdash;With 1744 began the Second Silesian
  War. Frederick, disquieted by the universal success of the Austrian
  cause, secretly concluded a fresh alliance with Louis XV. France had
  posed hitherto as an auxiliary, her officers in Germany had worn the
  Bavarian cockade, and only with England was she officially at war. She
  now declared war direct upon Austria and Sardinia (April 1744). A corps
  was assembled at Dunkirk to support the cause of the Pretender in Great
  Britain, and Louis in person, with 90,000 men, prepared to invade the
  Austrian Netherlands, and took Menin and Ypres. His presumed opponent was
  the allied army previously under King George and now composed of English,
  Dutch, Germans and Austrians. On the Rhine, Coigny was to make head
  against Prince Charles, and a fresh army under the prince de Conti was to
  assist the Spaniards in Piedmont and Lombardy. This plan was, however, at
  once dislocated by the advance of Charles, who, assisted by the veteran
  Traun, skilfully man&oelig;uvred his army over the Rhine near Philipsburg
  (July 1), captured the lines of Weissenburg, and cut off the French
  marshal from Alsace. Coigny, however, cut his way through the enemy at
  Weissenburg and posted himself near Strassburg. Louis XV. now abandoned
  the invasion of Flanders, and his army moved down to take a decisive part
  <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[v.03
  p.0042]</span>in the war in Alsace and Lorraine. At the same time
  Frederick crossed the Austrian frontier (August).</p>

  <p>The attention and resources of Austria were fully occupied, and the
  Prussians were almost unopposed. One column passed through Saxony,
  another through Lusatia, while a third advanced from Silesia. Prague, the
  objective, was reached on the 2nd of September. Six days later the
  Austrian garrison was compelled to surrender, and the Prussians advanced
  to Budweis. Maria Theresa once again rose to the emergency, a new
  "insurrection" took the field in Hungary, and a corps of regulars was
  assembled to cover Vienna, while the diplomatists won over Saxony to the
  Austrian side. Prince Charles withdrew from Alsace, unmolested by the
  French, who had been thrown into confusion by the sudden and dangerous
  illness of Louis XV. at Metz. Only Seckendorf with the Bavarians pursued
  him. No move was made by the French, and Frederick thus found himself
  after all isolated and exposed to the combined attack of the Austrians
  and Saxons. Marshal Traun, summoned from the Rhine, held the king in
  check in Bohemia, the Hungarian irregulars inflicted numerous minor
  reverses on the Prussians, and finally Prince Charles arrived with the
  main army. The campaign resembled that of 1742; the Prussian retreat was
  closely watched, and the rearguard pressed hard. Prague fell, and
  Frederick, completely outman&oelig;uvred by the united forces of Prince
  Charles and Traun, regained Silesia with heavy losses. At the same time,
  the Austrians gained no foothold in Silesia itself. On the Rhine, Louis,
  now recovered, had besieged and taken Freiburg, after which the forces
  left in the north were reinforced and besieged the strong places of
  Flanders. There was also a slight war of man&oelig;uvre on the middle
  Rhine.</p>

  <p>In 1744 the Italian war became for the first time serious. A grandiose
  plan of campaign was formed, and as usual the French and Spanish generals
  at the front were hampered by the orders of their respective governments.
  The object was to unite the army in Dauphiné with that on the lower Po.
  The adhesion of Genoa was secured, and a road thereby obtained into
  central Italy. But Lobkowitz had already taken the offensive and driven
  back the Spanish army of Count de Gages towards the Neapolitan frontier.
  The king of Naples at this juncture was compelled to assist the Spaniards
  at all hazards. A combined army was formed at Velletri, and defeated
  Lobkowitz there on the 11th of August. The crisis past, Lobkowitz then
  went to Piedmont to assist the king against Conti, the king of Naples
  returned home, and de Gages followed the Austrians with a weak force. The
  war in the Alps and the Apennines was keenly contested. Villefranche and
  Montalban were stormed by Conti on the 20th of April, a desperate fight
  took place at Peyre-Longue on the 18th of July, and the king of Sardinia
  was defeated in a great battle at Madonna del Olmo (September 30) near
  Coni (Cuneo). Conti did not, however, succeed in taking this fortress,
  and had to retire into Dauphiné for his winter quarters. The two armies
  had, therefore, failed in their attempt to combine, and the
  Austro-Sardinians still lay between them.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Campaign of 1745.</i>&mdash;The interest of the next campaign
  centres in the three greatest battles of the war&mdash;Hohenfriedberg,
  Kesselsdorf and Fontenoy. The first event of the year was the Quadruple
  Alliance of England, Austria, Holland and Saxony, concluded at Warsaw on
  the 8th of January. Twelve days previously, the death of Charles VII.
  submitted the imperial title to a new election, and his successor in
  Bavaria was not a candidate. The Bavarian army was again unfortunate;
  caught in its scattered winter quarters (action of Amberg, January 7), it
  was driven from point to point, and the young elector had to abandon
  Munich once more. The peace of Füssen followed on the 22nd of April, by
  which he secured his hereditary states on condition of supporting the
  candidature of the grand-duke Francis, consort of Maria Theresa. The
  "imperial" army ceased <i>ipso facto</i> to exist, and Frederick was
  again isolated. No help was to be expected from France, whose efforts
  this year were centred on the Flanders campaign. In effect, on the 10th
  of May, before Frederick took the field, Louis XV. and Saxe had besieged
  Tournay, and inflicted upon the relieving army of the duke of Cumberland
  the great defeat of Fontenoy (<i>q.v.</i>). In Silesia the customary
  small war had been going on for some time, and the concentration of the
  Prussian army was not effected without severe fighting. At the end of
  May, Frederick, with about 65,000 men, lay in the camp of Frankenstein,
  between Glatz and Neisse, while behind the Riesengebirge about Landshut
  Prince Charles had 85,000 Austrians and Saxons. On the 4th of June was
  fought the battle of Hohenfriedberg (<i>q.v.</i>) or Striegau, the
  greatest victory as yet of Frederick's career, and, of all his battles,
  excelled perhaps by Leuthen and Rossbach only. Prince Charles suffered a
  complete defeat and withdrew through the mountains as he had come.
  Frederick's pursuit was methodical, for the country was difficult and
  barren, and he did not know the extent to which the enemy was
  demoralized. The man&oelig;uvres of both leaders on the upper Elbe
  occupied all the summer, while the political questions of the imperial
  election and of an understanding between Prussia and England were
  pending. The chief efforts of Austria were directed towards the valleys
  of the Main and Lahn and Frankfort, where the French and Austrian armies
  man&oelig;uvred for a position from which to overawe the electoral body.
  Marshal Traun was successful, and the grand-duke became the emperor
  Francis I. on the 13th of September. Frederick agreed with England to
  recognize the election a few days later, but Maria Theresa would not
  conform to the treaty of Breslau without a further appeal to the fortune
  of war. Saxony joined in this last attempt. A new advance of Prince
  Charles quickly brought on the battle of Soor, fought on ground destined
  to be famous in the war of 1866. Frederick was at first in a position of
  great peril, but his army changed front in the face of the advancing
  enemy and by its boldness and tenacity won a remarkable victory
  (September 30). But the campaign was not ended. An Austrian contingent
  from the Main joined the Saxons under Marshal Rutowski, and a combined
  movement was made in the direction of Berlin by Rutowski from Saxony and
  Prince Charles from Bohemia. The danger was very great. Frederick hurried
  up his forces from Silesia and marched as rapidly as possible on Dresden,
  winning the actions of Katholisch-Hennersdorf (November 24) and Görlitz
  (November 25). Prince Charles was thereby forced back, and now a second
  Prussian army under the old Dessauer advanced up the Elbe from Magdeburg
  to meet Rutowski. The latter took up a strong position at Kesselsdorf
  between Meissen and Dresden, but the veteran Leopold attacked him
  directly and without hesitation (December 14). The Saxons and their
  allies were completely routed after a hard struggle, and Maria Theresa at
  last gave way. In the peace of Dresden (December 25) Frederick recognized
  the imperial election, and retained Silesia, as at the peace of
  Breslau.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Operations in Italy, 1745-1747.</i>&mdash;The campaign in Italy
  this year was also no mere war of posts. In March 1745 a secret treaty
  allied the Genoese republic with France, Spain and Naples. A change in
  the command of the Austrians favoured the first move of the allies, De
  Gages moved from Modena towards Lucca, the French and Spaniards in the
  Alps under Marshal Maillebois advanced through the Riviera to the Tanaro,
  and in the middle of July the two armies were at last concentrated
  between the Scrivia and the Tanaro, to the <span class="correction"
  title="'unusally' in original">unusually</span> large number of 80,000. A
  swift march on Piacenza drew the Austrian commander thither, and in his
  absence the allies fell upon and completely defeated the Sardinians at
  Bassignano (September 27), a victory which was quickly followed by the
  capture of Alessandria, Valenza and Casale. Jomini calls the
  concentration of forces which effected the victory "le plus remarquable
  de toute la guerre." But the complicated politics of Italy brought it
  about that Maillebois was ultimately unable to turn his victory to
  account. Indeed, early in 1746, Austrian troops, freed by the peace with
  Frederick, passed through Tirol into Italy; the Franco-Spanish winter
  quarters were brusquely attacked, and a French garrison of 6000 men at
  Asti was forced to capitulate. At the same time Count Browne with an
  Austrian corps struck at the allies on the lower Po, and cut off their
  communication with the main body <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>[v.03 p.0043]</span>in Piedmont. A series of minor
  actions thus completely destroyed the great concentration. The allies
  separated, Maillebois covering Liguria, the Spaniards marching against
  Browne. The latter was promptly and heavily reinforced, and all that the
  Spaniards could do was to entrench themselves at Piacenza; the Spanish
  Infant as supreme commander calling up Maillebois to his aid. The French,
  skilfully conducted and marching rapidly, joined forces once more, but
  their situation was critical, for only two marches behind them the army
  of the king of Sardinia was in pursuit, and before them lay the principal
  army of the Austrians. The pitched battle of Piacenza (June 16) was hard
  fought, and Maillebois had nearly achieved a victory when orders from the
  Infant compelled him to retire. That the army escaped at all was in the
  highest degree creditable to Maillebois and to his son and chief of
  staff, under whose leadership it eluded both the Austrians and the
  Sardinians, defeated an Austrian corps in the battle of Rottofreddo
  (August 12), and made good its retreat on Genoa. It was, however, a mere
  remnant of the allied army which returned, and the Austrians were soon
  masters of north Italy, including Genoa (September). But they met with no
  success in their forays towards the Alps. Soon Genoa revolted from the
  oppressive rule of the victors, rose and drove out the Austrians
  (December 5-11), and the French, now commanded by Belleisle, took the
  offensive (1747). Genoa held out against a second Austrian siege, and
  after the plan of campaign had as usual been referred to Paris and
  Madrid, it was relieved, though a picked corps of the French army under
  the chevalier de Belleisle, brother of the marshal, was defeated in the
  almost impossible attempt (July 19) to storm the entrenched pass of
  Exiles (Col di Assietta), the chevalier, and with him the <i>élite</i> of
  the French nobility, being killed at the barricades. Before the steady
  advance of Marshal Belleisle the Austrians retired into Lombardy, and a
  desultory campaign was waged up to the conclusion of peace.</p>

  <p>In North America the most remarkable incident of what has been called
  "King George's War" was the capture of the French Canadian fortress of
  Louisburg by a British expedition (April 20-June 16, 1745), of which the
  military portion was furnished by the colonial militia under Colonel
  (afterwards Lieutenant-General Sir William) Pepperell (1696-1759) of
  Maine. Louisburg was then regarded merely as a nest of privateers, and at
  the peace it was given up, but in the Seven Years' War it came within the
  domain of grand strategy, and its second capture was the preliminary step
  to the British conquest of Canada. For the war in India, see <span
  class="sc">India</span>: <i>History</i>.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Later Campaigns.</i>&mdash;The last three campaigns of the war
  in the Netherlands were illustrated by the now fully developed genius of
  Marshal Saxe. After Fontenoy the French carried all before them. The
  withdrawal of most of the English to aid in suppressing the 'Forty-Five
  rebellion at home left their allies in a helpless position. In 1746 the
  Dutch and the Austrians were driven back towards the line of the Meuse,
  and most of the important fortresses were taken by the French. The battle
  of Roucoux (or Raucourt) near Liége, fought on the 11th of October
  between the allies under Prince Charles of Lorraine and the French under
  Saxe, resulted in a victory for the latter. Holland itself was now in
  danger, and when in April 1747 Saxe's army, which had now conquered the
  Austrian Netherlands up to the Meuse, turned its attention to the United
  Provinces, the old fortresses on the frontier offered but slight
  resistance. The prince of Orange and the duke of Cumberland underwent a
  severe defeat at Lauffeld (Lawfeld, &amp;c., also called Val) on the 2nd
  of July 1747, and Saxe, after his victory, promptly and secretly
  despatched a corps under (Marshal) Löwendahl to besiege Bergen-op-Zoom.
  On the 18th of September Bergen-op-Zoom was stormed by the French, and in
  the last year of the war Maestricht, attacked by the entire forces of
  Saxe and Löwendahl, surrendered on the 7th of May 1748. A large Russian
  army arrived on the Meuse to join the allies, but too late to be of use.
  The quarrel of Russia and Sweden had been settled by the peace of Abo in
  1743, and in 1746 Russia had allied herself with Austria. Eventually a
  large army marched from Moscow to the Rhine, an event which was not
  without military significance, and in a manner preluded the great
  invasions of 1813-1814 and 1815. The general peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
  (Aachen) was signed on the 18th of October 1748.</p>

  <p>11. <i>General Character of the War.</i>&mdash;Little need be said of
  the military features of the war. The intervention of Prussia as a
  military power was indeed a striking phenomenon, but her triumph was in a
  great measure due to her fuller application of principles of tactics and
  discipline universally recognized though less universally enforced. The
  other powers reorganized their forces after the war, not so much on the
  Prussian model as on the basis of a stricter application of known general
  principles. Prussia, moreover, was far ahead of all the other continental
  powers in administration, and over Austria, in particular, her advantage
  in this matter was almost decisive of the struggle. Added to this was the
  personal ascendancy of Frederick, not yet a great general, but energetic
  and resolute, and, further, opposed to generals who were responsible for
  their men to their individual sovereigns. These advantages have been
  decisive in many wars, almost in all. The special feature of the war of
  1740 to 1748, and of other wars of the time, is the extraordinary
  disparity between the end and the means. The political schemes to be
  executed by the French and other armies were as grandiose as any of
  modern times; their execution, under the then conditions of time and
  space, invariably fell short of expectation, and the history of the war
  proves, as that of the Seven Years' War was to prove, that the small
  standing army of the 18th century could conquer by degrees, but could not
  deliver a decisive blow. Frederick alone, with a definite end and
  proportionate means wherewith to achieve it, succeeded completely. The
  French, in spite of their later victories, obtained so little of what
  they fought for that Parisians could say to each other, when they met in
  the streets, "You are as stupid as the Peace." And if, when fighting for
  their own hand, the governments of Europe could so fail of their purpose,
  even less was to be expected when the armies were composed of allied
  contingents, sent to the war each for a different object. The allied
  national armies of 1813 co-operated loyally, for they had much at stake
  and worked for a common object; those of 1741 represented the divergent
  private interests of the several dynasties, and achieved nothing.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Naval Operations.</i></p>

  <p>The naval operations of this war were languid and confused. They are
  complicated by the fact that they were entangled with the Spanish war,
  which broke out in 1739 in consequence of the long disputes between
  England and Spain over their conflicting claims in America. Until the
  closing years they were conducted with small intelligence or spirit. The
  Spanish government was nerveless, and sacrificed its true interest to the
  family ambition of the king Philip V., who wished to establish his
  younger sons as ruling princes in Italy. French administration was
  corrupt, and the government was chiefly concerned in its political
  interests in Germany. The British navy was at its lowest point of energy
  <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[v.03
  p.0044]</span>and efficiency after the long administration of Sir Robert
  Walpole. Therefore, although the war contained passages of vigour, it was
  neither interesting nor decisive on the sea.</p>

  <p>War on Spain was declared by Great Britain on the 23rd of October
  1739. It was universally believed that the Spanish colonies would fall at
  once before attack. A plan was laid for combined operations against them
  from east and west. One force, military and naval, was to assault them
  from the West Indies under Admiral Edward Vernon. Another, to be
  commanded by Commodore George Anson, afterwards Lord Anson, was to round
  Cape Horn and to fall upon the Pacific coast. Delays, bad preparations,
  dockyard corruption, and the unpatriotic squabbles of the naval and
  military officers concerned caused the failure of a hopeful scheme. On
  the 21st of November 1739 Admiral Vernon did indeed succeed in capturing
  the ill-defended Spanish harbour of Porto Bello (in the present republic
  of Panama)&mdash;a trifling success to boast of. But he did nothing to
  prevent the Spanish convoys from reaching Europe. The Spanish privateers
  cruised with destructive effect against British trade, both in the West
  Indies and in European waters. When Vernon had been joined by Sir
  Chaloner Ogle with naval reinforcements and a strong body of troops, an
  attack was made on Cartagena in what is now Colombia (March 9-April 24,
  1741). The delay had given the Spanish admiral, Don Bias de Leso, time to
  prepare, and the siege failed with a dreadful loss of life to the
  assailants. Want of success was largely due to the incompetence of the
  military officers and the brutal insolence of the admiral. The war in the
  West Indies, after two other unsuccessful attacks had been made on
  Spanish territory, died down and did not revive till 1748. The expedition
  under Anson sailed late, was very ill provided, and less strong than had
  been intended. It consisted of six ships and left England on the 18th of
  September 1740. Anson returned alone with his flagship the "Centurion" on
  the 15th of June 1744. The other vessels had either failed to round the
  Horn or had been lost. But Anson had harried the coast of Chile and Peru
  and had captured a Spanish galleon of immense value near the Philippines.
  His cruise was a great feat of resolution and endurance.</p>

  <p>While Anson was pursuing his voyage round the world, Spain was mainly
  intent on the Italian policy of the king. A squadron was fitted out at
  Cadiz to convey troops to Italy. It was watched by the British admiral
  Nicholas Haddock. When the blockading squadron was forced off by want of
  provisions, the Spanish admiral Don José Navarro put to sea. He was
  followed, but when the British force came in sight of him Navarro had
  been joined by a French squadron under M. de Court (December 1741). The
  French admiral announced that he would support the Spaniards if they were
  attacked and Haddock retired. France and Great Britain were not yet
  openly at war, but both were engaged in the struggle in
  Germany&mdash;Great Britain as the ally of the queen of Hungary, Maria
  Theresa; France as the supporter of the Bavarian claimant of the empire.
  Navarro and M. de Court went on to Toulon, where they remained till
  February 1744. A British fleet watched them, under the command of admiral
  Richard Lestock, till Sir Thomas Mathews was sent out as
  commander-in-chief, and as minister to the court of Turin. Partial
  manifestations of hostility between the French and British took place in
  different seas, but avowed war did not begin till the French government
  issued its declaration of the 30th of March, to which Great Britain
  replied on the 31st. This formality had been preceded by French
  preparations for the invasion of England, and by a collision between the
  allies and Mathews in the Mediterranean (see <span class="sc">Toulon,
  Battle of</span>). On the 11th of February a most confused battle was
  fought, in which the van and centre of the British fleet was engaged with
  the rear and centre of the allies. Lestock, who was on the worst possible
  terms with his superior, took no part in the action. He endeavoured to
  excuse himself by alleging that the orders of Mathews were contradictory.
  Mathews, a puzzle-headed and hot-tempered man, fought with spirit but in
  a disorderly way, breaking the formation of his fleet, and showing no
  power of direction. The mismanagement of the British fleet in the battle,
  by arousing deep anger among the people, led to a drastic reform of the
  British navy which bore its first fruits before the war ended.</p>

  <p>The French invasion scheme was arranged in combination with the
  Jacobite leaders, and soldiers were to be transported from Dunkirk. But
  though the British government showed itself wholly wanting in foresight,
  the plan broke down. In February 1744, a French fleet of twenty sail of
  the line entered the Channel under Jacques Aymar, comte de Roquefeuil,
  before the British force under admiral John Norris was ready to oppose
  him. But the French force was ill equipped, the admiral was nervous, his
  mind dwelt on all the misfortunes which might possibly happen, and the
  weather was bad. M. de Roquefeuil came up almost as far as the Downs,
  where he learnt that Sir John Norris was at hand with twenty-five sail of
  the line, and thereupon precipitately retreated. The military expedition
  prepared at Dunkirk to cross under cover of Roquefeuil's fleet naturally
  did not start. The utter weakness of the French at sea, due to long
  neglect of the fleet and the bankrupt state of the treasury, was shown
  during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when France made no attempt to profit
  by the distress of the British government. The Dutch having by this time
  joined Great Britain, made a serious addition to the naval power opposed
  to France, though Holland was compelled by the necessity for maintaining
  an army in Flanders to play a very subordinate part at sea. Not being
  stimulated by formidable attack, and having immediate interests both at
  home and in Germany, the British government was slow to make use of its
  latest naval strength. Spain, which could do nothing of an offensive
  character, was almost neglected. During 1745 the New England expedition
  which took Louisburg (April 30-June 16) was covered by a British naval
  force, but the operations were in a general way sporadic, subordinated to
  the supply of convoy, or to unimportant particular ends. In the East
  Indies, Mahé de la Bourdonnais made a vigorous use of a small squadron to
  which no effectual resistance was offered by the British naval forces. He
  captured Madras (July 24-September 9, 1746), a set-off for Louisburg, for
  which it was exchanged at the close of the war. In the same year a
  British combined naval and military expedition to the coast of
  France&mdash;the first of a long series of similar ventures which in the
  end were derided as "breaking windows with guineas"&mdash;was carried out
  during August and October. The aim was the capture of the French East
  India company's dockyard at L'Orient, but it was not attained.</p>

  <p>From 1747 till the close of the war in October 1748 the naval policy
  of the British government, without reaching a high level, was yet more
  energetic and coherent. A closer watch was kept on the French coast, and
  effectual means were taken to intercept communication between France and
  her American possessions. In the spring information was obtained that an
  important convoy for the East and West Indies was to sail from L'Orient.
  In the previous year the British government had allowed a French
  expedition under M. d'Anville to fail mainly by its own weakness. In 1747
  a more creditable line was taken. An overwhelming force was employed
  under the command of Anson to intercept the convoy in the Channel. It was
  met, crushed and captured, or driven back, on the 3rd of May. On the 14th
  of October another French convoy, protected by a strong squadron, was
  intercepted by a well-appointed and well-directed squadron of superior
  numbers&mdash;the squadrons were respectively eight French and fourteen
  British&mdash;in the Bay of Biscay. The French admiral Desherbiers de
  l'Étenduère made a very gallant resistance, and the fine quality of his
  ships enabled him to counteract to some extent the superior numbers of
  Sir Edward Hawke, the British admiral. While the war-ships were engaged,
  the merchant vessels, with the small protection which Desherbiers could
  spare them, continued on their way to the West Indies. Most of them were,
  however, intercepted and captured in those waters. This disaster
  convinced the French government of its helplessness at sea, and it made
  no further effort.</p>

  <p>The last naval operations took place in the West Indies, where the
  Spaniards, who had for a time been treated as a negligible quantity, were
  attacked on the coast of Cuba by a British <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[v.03 p.0045]</span>squadron under
  Sir Charles Knowles. They had a naval force under Admiral Regio at
  Havana. Each side was at once anxious to cover its own trade, and to
  intercept that of the other. Capture was rendered particularly desirable
  to the British by the fact that the Spanish homeward-bound convoy would
  be laden with the bullion sent from the American mines. In the course of
  the movement of each to protect its trade, the two squadrons met on the
  1st of October 1748 in the Bahama Channel. The action was indecisive when
  compared with the successes of British fleets in later days, but the
  advantage lay with Sir Charles Knowles. He was prevented from following
  it up by the speedy receipt of the news that peace had been made in
  Europe by the powers, who were all in various degrees exhausted. That it
  was arranged on the terms of a mutual restoration of conquests shows that
  none of the combatants could claim to have established a final
  superiority. The conquests of the French in the Bay of Bengal, and their
  military successes in Flanders, enabled them to treat on equal terms, and
  nothing had been taken from Spain.</p>

  <p>The war was remarkable for the prominence of privateering on both
  sides. It was carried on by the Spaniards in the West Indies with great
  success, and actively at home. The French were no less active in all
  seas. Mahé de la Bourdonnais's attack on Madras partook largely of the
  nature of a privateering venture. The British retaliated with vigour. The
  total number of captures by French and Spanish corsairs was in all
  probability larger than the list of British&mdash;partly for the reason
  given by Voltaire, namely, that more British merchants were taken because
  there were many more British merchant ships to take, but partly also
  because the British government had not yet begun to enforce the use of
  convoy so strictly as it did in later times.</p>

  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, and <span title="chthôn" class="grk"
  >&chi;&theta;&#x1F7D;&nu;</span>, earth, <i>i.e.</i> people sprung from
  earth itself; Lat. <i>terrigenae</i>; see also under <span
  class="sc">Aborigines</span>), the original inhabitants of a country as
  opposed to settlers, and those of their descendants who kept themselves
  free from an admixture of foreign peoples. The practice in ancient Greece
  of describing legendary heroes and men of ancient lineage as "earthborn"
  greatly strengthened the doctrine of autochthony; for instance, the
  Athenians wore golden grasshoppers in their hair in token that they were
  born from the soil and had always lived in Attica (Thucydides i. 6;
  Plato, <i>Menexenus</i>, 245). In Thebes, the race of Sparti were
  believed to have sprung from a field sown with dragons' teeth. The
  Phrygian Corybantes had been forced out of the hill-side like trees by
  Rhea, the great mother, and hence were called <span title="dendrophueis" class="grk"
  >&delta;&epsilon;&nu;&delta;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&upsilon;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&sigmaf;</span>.
  It is clear from Aeschylus (<i>Prometheus</i>, 447) that primitive men
  were supposed to have at first lived like animals in caves and woods,
  till by the help of the gods and heroes they were raised to a stage of
  civilization.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOCLAVE,</b> a strong closed vessel of metal in which liquids can
  be heated above their boiling points under pressure. Etymologically the
  word indicates a self-closing vessel (<span title="autos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, and <i>clavis</i>,
  key, or <i>clavus</i>, nail), in which the tightness of the joints is
  maintained by the internal pressure, but this characteristic is
  frequently wanting in the actual apparatus to which the name is applied.
  The prototype of the autoclave was the digester of Denis Papin, invented
  in 1681, which is still used in cooking, but the appliance finds a much
  wider range of employment in chemical industry, where it is utilized in
  various forms in the manufacture of candles, coal-tar colours, &amp;c.
  Frequently an agitator, passing through a stuffing-box, is fitted so that
  the contents may be stirred, and renewable linings are provided in cases
  where the substances under treatment exert a corrosive action on
  metal.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOCRACY</b> (Gr. <span title="autokrateia" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&#x1F71;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>,
  absolute power), a term applied to that form of government which is
  absolute or irresponsible, and vested in one single person. It is a type
  of government usually found amongst eastern peoples; amongst more
  civilized nations the only example is that of Russia, where the sovereign
  assumes as a title "the autocrat of all the Russias."</p>

  <p><b>AUTO-DA-FÉ,</b> more correctly <span class="sc">Auto-de-fé</span>
  (act of faith), the name of the ceremony during the course of which the
  sentences of the Spanish inquisition were read and executed. The
  auto-da-fe was almost identical with the <i>sermo generalis</i> of the
  medieval inquisition. It never took place on a feast day of the church,
  but on some famous anniversary: the accession of a Spanish monarch, his
  marriage, the birth of an infant, &amp;c. It was public: the king, the
  royal family, the grand councils of the kingdom, the court and the people
  being present. The ceremony comprised a procession in which the members
  of the Holy Office, with its familiars and agents, the condemned persons
  and the penitents took part; a solemn mass; an oath of obedience to the
  inquisition, taken by the king and all the lay functionaries; a sermon by
  the Grand Inquisitor; and the reading of the sentences, either of
  condemnation or acquittal, delivered by the Holy Office. The handing over
  of impenitent persons, and those who had relapsed, to the secular power,
  and their punishment, did not usually take place on the occasion of an
  auto-da-fé, properly so called. Sometimes those who were condemned to the
  flames were burned on the night following the ceremony. The first great
  auto-da-fés were celebrated when Thomas de Torquemada, was at the head of
  the Spanish inquisition (Seville 1482, Toledo 1486, &amp;c.). The last,
  subsequent to the time of Charles III., were held in secret; moreover,
  they dealt with only a very small number of sentences, of which hardly
  any were capital. The isolated cases of the torturing of a revolutionary
  priest in Mexico in 1816, and of a relapsed Jew and of a Quaker in Spain
  during 1826, cannot really be considered as auto-da-fés.</p>

  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, and <span

  <p><b>AUTOGENY, AUTOGENOUS</b> (Gr. <span title="autogenês" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&#x1F75;&sigmaf;</span>),
  spontaneous generation, self-produced. Haeckel distinguished
  <i>autogeny</i> and <i>plasmogeny</i>, applying the former term when the
  formative fluid in which the first living matter was supposed to arise
  was inorganic and the latter when it was organic, <i>i.e.</i> contained
  the requisite fundamental substances dissolved in the form of complicated
  and fluid combinations of carbon. In "autogenous soldering" two pieces of
  metal are united by the melting of the opposing surfaces, without the use
  of a separate fusible alloy or solder as a cementing material.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOGRAPHS</b>. Autograph (Gr. <span title="autos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, <span
  title="graphein" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&rho;&#x1F71;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>, to write) is a term
  applied by common usage either to a document signed by the person from
  whom it emanates, or to one written entirely by the hand of such person
  (which, however, is also more technically described as <i>holograph</i>,
  from <span title="holos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F45;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, entire, <span title="graphein" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&rho;&#x1F71;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>, to write), or
  simply to an independent signature.</p>

  <p>The existence of autographs must necessarily have been coeval with the
  invention of letters. Documents in the handwriting of their composers may
  possibly exist among the early papyri of Egypt and the clay tablets of
  Babylonia and Assyria, and among the early examples of writing in the
  East. But the oriental practice of employing professional scribes in
  writing the body of documents and of using seals for the purpose of
  "signing" (the "signum" originally meaning the impression of the seal)
  almost precludes the idea. When we are told (1 Kings xxi. 8) that Jezebel
  wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, we are, of
  course, to understand that the letters were written by the professional
  scribes and that the impression of the king's seal was the
  authentication, equivalent to the signature of western nations; and
  again, when King Darius "signed" the writing and the decree (Dan. vi. 9),
  he did so with his seal. To find documents which we can <!-- Page 46
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>[v.03
  p.0046]</span>recognize with certainty to be autographs, we must descend
  to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods of Egyptian history, which are
  represented by an abundance of papyrus documents of all kinds, chiefly in
  Greek. Among them are not a few original letters and personal documents,
  in which we may see the handwriting of many lettered and unlettered
  individuals who lived during the 3rd century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> and in succeeding times, and which prove how
  very widespread was the practice of writing in those days. We owe it to
  the dry and even atmosphere of Egypt that these written documents have
  been preserved in such numbers. On the other hand, in Italy and Greece
  ancient writings have perished, save the few charred papyrus rolls and
  waxen tablets which have been recovered from the ruins of Herculaneum and
  Pompeii. These tablets, however, have a special value, for many of them
  contain autograph signatures of principals and witnesses to legal deeds
  to which they were attached, together with impressions of seals, in
  compliance with the Roman law which required the actual subscriptions, or
  attested marks, of the persons concerned.</p>

  <p>But, when we now speak of autographs and autograph collections, we use
  such terms in a restricted sense and imply documents or signatures
  written by persons of some degree of eminence or notoriety in the various
  ranks and professions of life; and naturally the only early autographs in
  this sense which could be expected to survive are the subscriptions and
  signatures of royal personages and great officials attached to important
  public deeds, which from their nature have been more jealously cared for
  than mere private documents.</p>

  <p>Following the Roman practice, subscriptions and signatures were
  required in legal documents in the early centuries of our era. Hence we
  find them in the few Latin deeds on papyrus which have come to light in
  Egypt; we find them on the well-known Dacian waxen tablets of the 2nd
  century; and we find them in the series of papyrus deeds from Ravenna and
  other places in Italy between the 5th and 10th centuries. The same
  practice obtained in the Frankish empire. The Merovingian kings, or at
  least those of them who knew how to write, subscribed their diplomas and
  great charters with their own hands; and their great officers of state,
  chancellors and others, countersigned in autograph. The unlettered
  Merovingian kings made use of monograms composed of the letters of their
  names; and, curiously, the illiterate monogram was destined to supersede
  the literate subscriptions. For the monogram was adopted by Charlemagne
  and his successors as a recognized symbol of their subscription. It was
  their <i>signum manuale</i>, their sign manual. In courtly imitation of
  the royal practice, monograms and other marks were adopted by official
  personages, even though they could write. The notarial marks of modern
  times are a survival of the practice. By the illiterate other signs,
  besides the monogram, came to be employed, such as the cross, &amp;c., as
  signs manual. The monogram was used by French monarchs from the reign of
  Charlemagne to that of Philip the Fair, who died in 1314. It is very
  doubtful, however, whether in any instance this sign manual was actually
  traced by the monarch's own hand. At the most, the earlier sovereigns
  appear to have drawn one or two strokes in their monograms, which, so
  far, may be called their autographs. But in the later period not even
  this was done; the monogram was entirely the work of the scribe. (See
  <span class="sc">Diplomatic</span>.)</p>

  <p>The employment of marks or signs manual went out of general use after
  the 12th century, in the course of which the affixing or appending of
  seals became the common method of executing deeds. But, as education
  became more general and the practice of writing more widely diffused, the
  usage grew up in the course of the 14th century of signing the
  name-signature as well as of affixing the seal; and by the 15th century
  it had become established, and it remains to the present time. Thus the
  <i>signum manuale</i> had disappeared, except among notaries; but the
  term survived, and by a natural process it was transferred to the
  signature. In the present day it is used to designate the "sign manual"
  or autograph signature of the sovereign.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon kings of England did not sign their charters, their
  names being invariably written by the official scribes. After the Norman
  conquest, the sign manual, usually a cross, which sometimes accompanied
  the name of the sovereign, may in some instances be autograph; but no
  royal signature is to be found earlier than the reign of Richard II. Of
  the signatures of this king there are two examples, of the years 1386 and
  1389, in the Public Record Office; and there is one, of 1397, in the
  British Museum. Of his father, the Black Prince, there is in the Record
  Office a motto-signature, <i>De par Homont</i> (high courage), <i>Ich
  dene</i>, subscribed to a writ of privy seal of 1370. The kings of the
  Lancastrian line were apparently ready writers. Of the handwriting of
  both Henry IV. and Henry V. there are specimens both in the Record Office
  and in the British Museum. But by their time writing had become an
  ordinary accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Apart from the autographs of sovereigns, those of famous men of the
  early middle ages can hardly be said to exist, or, if they do exist, they
  are difficult to identify. For example, there is a charter at Canterbury
  bearing the statement that it was written by Dunstan; but, as there is a
  duplicate in the British Museum with the same statement, it is probable
  that both the one and the other are copies. The autograph MSS. of the
  chronicles of Ordericus Vitalis, of Robert de Monte, and of Sigebert of
  Gembloux are in existence; and among the Cottonian MSS. there are
  undoubtedly autograph writings of Matthew of Paris, the English
  chronicler of Henry III.'s reign. There are certain documents in the
  British Museum in the hand of William of Wykeham; and among French
  archives there are autograph writings of the historian Joinville. These
  are a few instances. When we come to such a collection as the famous
  Paston Letters, the correspondence of the Norfolk family of Paston of the
  15th century, we find therein numerous autographs of historical
  personages of the time.</p>

  <p>From the 16th century onward, we enter the period of modern history,
  and autograph documents of all kinds become plentiful. And yet in the
  midst of this plenty, by a perverse fate, there is in certain instances a
  remarkable dearth. The instance of Shakespeare is the most famous. But
  for three signatures to the three sheets of his will, and two signatures
  to the conveyances of property in Blackfriars, we should be without a
  vestige of his handwriting. For certain other signatures, professing to
  be his, inscribed in books, may be dismissed as imitations. Such
  forgeries come up from time to time, as might be expected, and are placed
  upon the market. The Shakespearean forgeries, however, of W.&nbsp;H. Ireland
  were perpetrated rather with a literary intent than as an autographic
  venture.</p>

  <p>Had autograph collecting been the fashion in Shakespeare's days, we
  should not have had to deplore the loss of his and of other great
  writers' autographs. But the taste had not then come into vogue, at least
  not in England. The series of autograph documents which were gathered in
  such a library as that of Sir Robert Cotton, now in the British Museum,
  found their way thither on account of their literary or historic
  interest, and not merely as specimens of the handwriting of distinguished
  men. Such a series also as that formed by Philippe de Béthune, Comte de
  Selles et Charost, and his son, in the reign of Louis XIV., consisting
  for the most part of original letters and papers, now in the Bibliothèque
  Nationale, might have been regarded as the result of autograph collecting
  did we not know that it was brought together for historical purposes. It
  was in Germany and the Low Countries that the practice appears to have
  originated, chiefly among students and other members of the universities,
  of collecting autograph inscriptions and signatures of one's friends in
  albums, <i>alba amicorum</i>, little oblong pocket volumes of which a
  considerable number have survived, a very fair collection being in the
  British Museum. The earliest album in the latter series is the Egerton
  MS. 1178, beginning with an entry of the year 1554. Once the taste was
  established, the collecting of autographs of living persons was naturally
  extended to those of former times; and many collections, famous in their
  day, have been formed, but in most instances only to be dispersed again
  as the owners tired of their fancy or as their heirs failed to inherit
  their tastes along with their <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>[v.03 p.0047]</span>possessions. The most celebrated
  collection formed in England in recent years is that of the late Mr
  Alfred Morrison, which still remains intact, and which is well known by
  means of the sumptuous catalogue, with its many facsimiles, compiled by
  the owner.</p>

  <p>The rivalry of collectors and the high prices which rare or favourite
  autographs realize have naturally given encouragement to the forger.
  False letters of popular heroes and of popular authors, of Nelson, of
  Burns, of Thackeray, and of others, appear from time to time in the
  market: in some instances clever imitations, but more generally too
  palpably spurious to deceive any one with experience. Like the
  Shakespearean forgeries of Ireland, referred to above, the forgeries of
  Chatterton were literary inventions; and both were poor performances. One
  of the cleverest frauds of this nature in modern times was the
  fabrication, in the middle of the 19th century, of a series of letters of
  Byron and Shelley, with postmarks and seals complete, which were even
  published as <i>bona fide</i> documents (Brit. Mus., Add. MS.
  19,377).</p>

  <p>There are many published collections of facsimiles of autographs of
  different nations. Among those published in England the following may be
  named:&mdash;<i>British Autography</i>, by J. Thane (1788-1793, with
  supplement by Daniell, 1854); <i>Autographs of Royal, Noble, Learned and

  <p><b>AUTOLYCUS,</b> in Greek mythology, the son of Hermes and father of
  Anticleia, mother of Odysseus. He lived at the foot of Mount Parnassus,
  and was famous as a thief and swindler. On one occasion he met his match.
  Sisyphus, who had lost some cattle, suspected Autolycus of being the
  thief, but was unable to bring it home to him, since he possessed the
  power of changing everything that was touched by his hands. Sisyphus
  accordingly burnt his name into the hoofs of his cattle, and, during a
  visit to Autolycus, recognized his property. It is said that on this
  occasion Sisyphus seduced Autolycus's daughter Anticleia, and that
  Odysseus was really the son of Sisyphus, not of Laertes, whom Anticleia
  afterwards married. The object of the story is to establish the close
  connexion between Hermes, the god of theft and cunning, and the three
  persons&mdash;Sisyphus, Odysseus, Autolycus&mdash;who are the incarnate
  representations of these practices. Autolycus is also said to have
  instructed Heracles in the art of wrestling, and to have taken part in
  the Argonautic expedition.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOLYCUS OF PITANE,</b> Greek mathematician and astronomer,
  probably flourished in the second half of the 4th century <span

  former treatise is historically interesting for the light it throws on
  the development which the geometry of the sphere had already reached even
  before Autolycus and Euclid (see <span class="sc">Theodosius of
  Tripolis</span>).</p>

  <p>There are several Latin versions of Autolycus, a French translation by
  Forcadel (1572), and an admirable edition of the Greek text with Latin
  translation by F. Hultsch (Leipzig, 1885).</p>

  <p><b>AUTOMATIC WRITING,</b> the name given by students of psychical
  research to writing performed without the volition of the agent. The
  writing may also take place without any consciousness of the words
  written; but some automatists are aware of the word which they are
  actually writing, and perhaps of two or three words on either side,
  though there is rarely any clear perception of the meaning of the whole.
  Automatic writing may take place when the agent is in a state of trance,
  spontaneous or induced, in hystero-epilepsy or other morbid states; or in
  a condition not distinguishable from normal wakefulness. Automatic
  writing has played an important part in the history of modern
  spiritualism. The phenomenon first appeared on a large scale in the early
  days (<i>c.</i> 1850-1860) of the movement in America. Numerous writings
  are reported at that period, many of considerable length, which purported
  for the most part to have been produced under spirit guidance. Some of
  these were written in "unknown tongues." Of those which were published
  the most notable are Andrew J. Davis's <i>Great Harmonia</i>, Charles
  Linton's <i>The Healing of the Nations</i>, and J. Murray Spear's
  <i>Messages from the Spirit Life</i>.</p>

  <p>In England also the early spiritualist newspapers were filled with
  "inspirational" writing,&mdash;<i>Pages of Ike Paraclete</i>, &amp;c. The
  most notable series of English automatic writings are the <i>Spirit
  Teachings</i> of the Rev. W. Stainton Moses. The phenomenon, of course,
  lends itself to deception, but there seems no reason to doubt that in the
  great majority of the cases recorded the writing was in reality produced
  without deliberate volition. In the earlier years of the spiritualist
  movement, a "planchette," a little heart-shaped board running on wheels,
  was employed to facilitate the process of writing.</p>

  <p>Of late years, whilst the theory of external inspiration as the cause
  of the phenomenon has been generally discredited, automatic writing has
  been largely employed as a method of experimentally investigating
  subconscious mental processes. Knowledge which had lapsed from the
  primary consciousness is frequently revealed by this means; <i>e.g.</i>
  forgotten fragments of poetry or foreign languages are occasionally
  given. An experimental parallel to this reproduction of forgotten
  knowledge was devised by Edmund Gurney. He showed that information
  communicated to a subject in the hypnotic trance could be subsequently
  reproduced through the handwriting, whilst the attention of the subject
  was fully employed in conversing or reading aloud; or an arithmetical
  problem which had been set during the trance could be worked out under
  similar conditions without the apparent consciousness of the subject.</p>

  <p>Automatic writing for the most part, no doubt, brings to the surface
  only the debris of lapsed memories and half-formed impressions which have
  never reached the focus of consciousness&mdash;the stuff that dreams are
  made of. But there are indications in some cases of something more than
  this. In some spontaneous instances the writing produces anagrams, puns,
  nonsense verses and occasional blasphemies or obscenities; and otherwise
  exhibits characteristics markedly divergent from those of the normal
  consciousness. In the well-known case recorded by Th. Flournoy (<i>Des
  Indes à la planète Mars</i>) the automatist produced writing in an
  unknown character, which purported to be the Martian language. The
  writing generally resembles the ordinary handwriting of the agent, but
  there are sometimes marked differences, and the same automatist may
  employ two or three distinct handwritings. Occasionally imitations are
  produced of the handwriting of other persons, living or dead. Not
  infrequently the writing is reversed, so that it can be read only in a
  looking-glass (<i>Spiegelschrift</i>); the ability to produce such
  writing is often associated with the liability to spontaneous
  somnambulism. The hand and arm are often insensible in the act of
  writing. There are some cases on record in which the automatist has
  seemed to guide his hand not by sight, but by some special extension of
  the muscular sense (Carpenter, <i>Mental Physiology</i>, § 128; W. James,
  <i>Proceedings American S.P.R</i>. p. 554).</p>

  <p>Automatic writing frequently exhibits indications of telepathy. The
  most remarkable series of automatic writings recorded in this connexion
  are those executed by the American medium, Mrs Piper, in a state of
  trance (<i>Proceedings S.P.R.</i>). These writings appear to exhibit
  remarkable telepathic powers, and are thought by some to indicate
  communication with the spirits of the dead.</p>

<p><!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[v.03 p.0048]</span></p>

  <p>The opportunities afforded by automatic writing for communicating with
  subconscious strata of the personality have been made use of by Pierre
  Janet and others in cases of hystero-epilepsy, and other forms of
  dissociation of consciousness. A patient in an attack of hysterical
  convulsions, to whom oral appeals are made in vain, can sometimes be
  induced to answer in writing questions addressed to the hand, and thus to
  reveal the secret of the malady or to accept therapeutic suggestions.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOMATISM</b>. In philosophical terminology this word is used in
  two main senses: (1) in ethics, for the view that man is not responsible
  for his actions, which have, therefore, no moral value; (2) in
  psychology, for all actions which are not the result of conation or
  conscious endeavour. Certain actions being admittedly automatic,
  Descartes maintained that, in regard of the lower animals, all action is
  purely mechanical. The same theory has since been applied to man, with
  this difference that, accompanying the mechanical phenomena of action,
  and entirely disconnected with it, are the phenomena of consciousness.
  Thus certain physical changes in the brain result in a given action; the
  concomitant mental desire or volition is in no sense causally connected
  with, or prior to, the physical change. This theory, which has been
  maintained by T. Huxley (<i>Science and Culture</i>) and Shadworth
  Hodgson (<i>Metaphysic of Experience and Theory of Practice</i>), must be
  distinguished from that of the psychophysical parallelism, or the "double
  aspect theory" according to which both the mental state and the physical
  phenomena result from a so-called "mind stuff," or single substance, the
  material or cause of both.</p>

  <p>Automatic acts are of two main kinds. Where the action goes on while
  the attention is focused on entirely different subjects (<i>e.g.</i> in
  cycling), it is purely automatic. On the other hand, if the attention is
  fixed on the end or on any particular part of a given action, and the
  other component parts of the action are performed unconsciously, the
  automatism may be called relative.</p>

  <p>See G. F. Stout, <i>Anal. Psych</i>, i. 258 foll.; Win. James,
  <i>Princ. of Psych.</i> i. chap. 5; also the articles <span
  class="sc">Psychology</span>, <span class="sc">Suggestion</span>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Sensory Automatism</i> is the term given by students of psychical
  research to a centrally initiated hallucination. Such hallucinations are
  commonly provoked by crystal-gazing (<i>q.v.</i>), but auditory
  hallucinations may be caused by the use of a shell (shell-hearing), and
  the other senses are occasionally affected.</p>

  <p><i>Motor Automatism</i>, on the other hand, is a non-reflex movement
  of a voluntary muscle, executed in the waking state but not controlled by
  the ordinary waking consciousness. Phenomena of this kind play a large
  part in primitive ceremonies of divination (<i>q.v.</i>) and in our own
  day furnish much of the material of Psychical Research. At the lowest
  level we have vague movements of large groups of muscles, as in
  "bier-divination," where the murderer or his residence is inferred from
  the actions of the bearers; of a similar character but combined with more
  specialized action are many kinds of witch seeking. These more
  specialized actions are most typically seen in the Divining Rod
  (<i>q.v.</i>; see also <span class="sc">Table-Turning</span>), which
  indicates the presence of water and is used among the uncivilized to
  trace criminals. At a higher stage still we have the delicate movements
  necessary for Automatic Writing (<i>q.v.</i>) or Drawing. A parallel case
  to Automatic Writing is the action of the speech centres, resulting in
  the production of all kinds of utterances from trance speeches in the
  ordinary language of the speaker to mere unintelligible babblings. An
  interesting form of speech automatism is known as Glossolalia; in the
  typical case of Helène Smith, Th. Flournoy has shown that these
  utterances may reach a higher plane and form a real language, which is,
  however, based on one already known to the speaker.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOMATON</b> (from <span title="autos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, and <span title="maô" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F71;&omega;</span>, to seize), a self-moving machine, or one in
  which the principle of motion is contained within the mechanism itself.
  According to this description, clocks, watches and all machines of a
  similar kind, are automata, but the word is generally applied to
  contrivances which simulate for a time the motions of animal life. If the
  human figure and actions be represented, the automaton has sometimes been
  called specially an <i>androides</i>. We have very early notices of the
  construction of automata, <i>e.g.</i> the tripods of Vulcan, and the
  moving figures of Daedalus. In 400 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  Archytas of Tarentum is said to have made a wooden pigeon that could fly,
  and during the middle ages numerous instances of the construction of
  automata are recorded. Regiomontanus is said to have made of iron a fly,
  which would flutter round the room and return to his hand, and also an
  eagle, which flew before the emperor Maximilian when he was entering
  Nuremberg. Roger Bacon is said to have forged a brazen head which spoke,
  and Albertus Magnus to have had an androides, which acted as doorkeeper,
  and was broken to pieces by Aquinas. Of these, as of some later
  instances, <i>e.g.</i> the figure constructed by Descartes and the
  automata exhibited by Dr Camus, not much is accurately known. But in the
  18th century, Jacques de Vaucanson, the celebrated mechanician, exhibited
  three admirable figures,&mdash;the flute-player, the tambourine-player,
  and the duck, which was capable of eating, drinking, and imitating
  exactly the natural voice of that fowl. The means by which these results
  had been produced were clearly seen, and a great impulse was given to the
  construction of similar figures. Knauss exhibited at Vienna an automaton
  which wrote; a father and son named Droz constructed several ingenious
  mechanical figures which wrote and played music; Frederick Kaufmann and
  Leonard Maelzel made automatic trumpeters who could play several marches.
  The Swiss have always been celebrated for their mechanical ingenuity, and
  they construct most of the curious toys, such as flying and singing
  birds, which are frequently met with in industrial exhibitions. The
  greatest difficulty has generally been experienced in devising any
  mechanism which shall successfully simulate the human voice (not to be
  compared with the gramophone, which reproduces mechanically a real
  voice). No attempt has been thoroughly successful, though many have been
  made. A figure exhibited by Fabermann of Vienna remains the best.
  Kempelen's famous chess-player for many years astonished and puzzled
  Europe. This figure, however, was no true automaton, although the
  mechanical contrivances for concealing the real performer and giving
  effect to his desired movements were exceedingly ingenious. J.&nbsp;N.
  Maskelyne, in more recent times (1875-1880), has been prominent in
  exhibiting his automata, Psycho (who played cards) and Zoe (who drew
  pictures), at the Egyptian Hall, London, but the secret of these
  contrivances was well kept. (See <span class="sc">Conjuring</span>.)</p>

  <p><b>AUTOMORPHISM</b> (from Gr. <span title="autos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, and <span
  title="morphê" class="grk">&mu;&omicron;&rho;&phi;&#x1F75;</span>, form),
  the conception and interpretation of other people's habits and ideas on
  the analogy of one's own.</p>

  <p><b>AUTONOMY</b> (Gr. <span title="autos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, and <span
  title="nomos" class="grk">&nu;&#x1F79;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, law),
  in general, freedom from external restraint, self-government. The term is
  usually coupled with a qualifying adjective. Thus, political autonomy is
  self-government in its widest sense, independence of all control from
  without. Local autonomy is a freedom of self-government within a sphere
  marked out by some superior authority; <i>e.g.</i> municipal corporations
  in England have their administrative powers marked out for them by acts
  of parliament, and in so far as they govern themselves within these
  limits exercise local autonomy. Administrative or constitutional
  autonomy, such as exists in the British colonies, implies an extent of
  self-government which falls short only of complete independence. The term
  is used loosely even in the case of <i>e.g.</i> religious bodies,
  individual churches and other communities <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[v.03 p.0049]</span>which enjoy a
  measure of self-government in certain specified respects.</p>

  <p>In philosophy, the term (with its antithesis "heteronomy") was applied
  by Kant to that aspect of the rational will in which, <i>qua</i>
  rational, it is a law to itself, independently alike of any external
  authority, of the results of experience and of the impulses of pleasure
  and pain. In the sphere of morals, the ultimate and only authority which
  the mind can recognize is the law which emerges from the pure moral
  consciousness. This is the only sense in which moral freedom can be
  understood. (See <span class="sc">Ethics</span>; <span
  class="sc">Kant</span>.) Though the term "autonomy" in its fullest sense
  implies entire freedom from causal necessity, it can also be used even in
  determinist theories for relative independence of particular conditions,
  theological or conventional.</p>

  <p><b>AUTOPSY</b> (Gr. <span title="autos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, self, and <span
  title="opsis" class="grk">&#x1F44;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, sight,
  investigation), a personal examination, specifically a <i>post-mortem</i>
  ("after death") examination of a dead body, to ascertain the cause of
  death, &amp;c. The term "necropsy" (Gr. <span title="nekros" class="grk"
  >&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&rho;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, corpse) is sometimes
  used in this sense. (See <span class="sc">Coroner</span> and <span
  class="sc">Medical Jurisprudence</span>.)</p>

  <p><b>AUTRAN, JOSEPH</b> (1813-1877), French poet, was born at Marseilles
  on the 20th of June 1813. In 1832 he addressed an ode to Lamartine, who
  was then at Marseilles on his way to the East. The elder poet persuaded
  the young man's father to allow him to follow his poetic bent, and Autran
  remained from that time a faithful disciple of Lamartine. His best known
  work is <i>La Mer</i> (1835), remodelled in 1852 as <i>Les Poèmes de la
  mer. Ludibria ventis</i> (1838) followed, and the success of these two
  volumes gained for Autran the librarianship of his native town. His other
  most important work is his <i>Vie rurale</i> (1856), a series of pictures
  of peasant life. The Algerian campaigns inspired him with verses in
  honour of the common soldier. <i>Milianah</i> (1842) describes the heroic
  defence of that town, and in the same vein is his <i>Laboureurs et
  soldats</i> (1854). Among his other works are the <i>Paroles de
  Salomon</i> (1868), <i>Épîtres rustiques</i> (1861), <i>Sonnets
  capricieux</i>, and a tragedy played with great success at the Odéon in
  1848, <i>La Fille d'Eschyle</i>. A definitive edition of his works was
  brought out between 1875 and 1881. He became a member of the French
  Academy in 1868, and died at Marseilles on the 6th of March 1877.</p>

  <p><b>AUTUN,</b> a town of east-central France, capital of an
  arrondissement in the department of Saône-et-Loire, 62 m. S.W. of Dijon
  on the Paris-Lyon railway to Nevers. Pop. (1906) 11,927. Autun is
  pleasantly situated on the slope of a hill at the foot of which runs the
  Arroux. Its former greatness is attested by many Roman remains, the chief
  of which are two well-preserved stone gateways, the Porte d' Arroux and
  the Porte St André, both pierced with four archways and surmounted by
  arcades. There are also remains of the old ramparts and aqueducts, of a
  square tower called the Temple of Janus, of a theatre and of an
  amphitheatre. A pyramid in the neighbouring village of Couhard was
  probably a sepulchral monument. The chapel of St Nicolas (12th century)
  contains many of the remains discovered at Autun. The cathedral of St
  Lazare, once the chapel attached to the residence of the dukes of
  Burgundy, is in the highest part of the town. It belongs mainly to the
  12th century, but the Gothic central tower and the chapels were added in
  the 15th century by Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of Burgundy, born at Autun.
  The chief artistic features of the church are the group of the Last
  Judgment sculptured on the tympanum above the west door, and the painting
  by Ingres representing the martyrdom of St Symphorien, which took place
  at Autun in 179. In the cathedral square stands the fountain of St
  Lazare, a work of the Renaissance. The hôtel Rolin, a house of the 15th
  century, contains the collections of the "Aeduan literary and scientific
  society." The hôtel de ville, containing a museum of paintings, the
  law-court and the theatre are modern buildings. Autun is the seat of a
  bishopric, of tribunals of first instance and of commerce, and has an
  ecclesiastical seminary, a communal college and a cavalry school. Among
  the industries of the town are the extraction of oil from the bituminous
  schist obtained in the neighbourhood, leather manufacture,
  metal-founding, marble-working, and the manufacture of machinery and
  furniture. Autun is the commercial centre for a large part of the Morvan,
  and has considerable trade in timber and cattle.</p>

  <p>Autun (<i>Augustodunum</i>) succeeded Bibracte as capital of the Aedui
  when Gaul was reorganized by Augustus. Under the Romans, it was a
  flourishing town, covering double its present extent and renowned for its
  schools of rhetoric. In the succeeding centuries its prosperity drew upon
  it the attacks of the barbarians, the Saracens and the Normans. The
  counts of Autun in 880 became dukes of Burgundy, and the town was the
  residence of the latter till 1276. It was ravaged by the English in 1379,
  and, in 1591, owing to its support of the League, had to sustain a siege
  conducted by Marshal Jean d'Aumont, general of Henry IV.</p>

  <p>See H. de Fontenay, <i>Autun et ses monuments</i> (Autun, 1889).</p>

  <p><b>AUTUNITE,</b> or <span class="sc">Calco-uranite</span>, a mineral
  which is one of the "uranium micas," differing from the more commonly
  occurring torbernite (<i>q.v.</i>) or cupro-uranite in containing calcium
  in place of copper. It is a hydrous uranium and calcium phosphate,
  Ca(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 8(or
  12)H<sub>2</sub>O. Though closely resembling the tetragonal torbernite in
  form, it crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and is optically
  biaxial. The crystals have the shape of thin plates with very nearly
  square outline (89° 17&prime; instead of 90°). An important character is
  the perfect micaceous cleavage parallel to the basal plane, on which
  plane the lustre is pearly. The colour is sulphur-yellow, and this
  enables the mineral to be distinguished at a glance from the
  emerald-green torbernite. Hardness 2-2½; specific gravity 3.05-3.19.
  Autunite is usually found with pitchblende and other uranium minerals, or
  with ores of silver, tin and iron; it sometimes coats joint-planes in
  gneiss and pegmatite. Falkenstein in Saxony, St Symphorien near Autun
  (hence the name of the species), and St Day in Cornwall are well-known
  localities for this mineral.</p>

  <p><b>AUVERGNE,</b> formerly a province of France, corresponding to the
  departments of Cantal and Puy-de-Dôme, with the arrondissement of Brioude
  in Haute-Loire. It contains many mountains volcanic in origin (Plomb du
  Cantal, Puy de Dôme, Mont Dore), fertile valleys such as that of Limagne,
  vast pasture-lands, and numerous medicinal springs. Up to the present day
  the population retains strongly-marked Celtic characteristics. In the
  time of Caesar the <i>Arverni</i> were a powerful confederation, the
  Arvernian Vercingetorix being the most famous of the Gallic chieftains
  who fought against the Romans. Under the empire <i>Arvernia</i> formed
  part of <i>Prima Aquitania</i>, and the district shared in the fortunes
  of Aquitaine during the Merovingian and Carolingian periods. Auvergne was
  the seat of a separate countship before the end of the 8th century; the
  first hereditary count was William the Pious (886). By the marriage of
  Eleanor of Aquitaine with Henry Plantagenet, the countship passed under
  the suzerainty of the kings of England, but at the same time it was
  divided, William VII., called the Young (1145-1168), having been
  despoiled of a portion of his domain by his uncle William VIII., called
  the Old, who was supported by Henry II. of England, so that he only
  retained the region bounded by the Allier and the Coux. It is this
  district that from the end of the 13th century was called the <i>Dauphiné
  d'Auvergne</i>. This family quarrel occasioned the intervention of Philip
  Augustus, king of France, who succeeded in possessing himself of a large
  part of the country, which was annexed to the royal domains under the
  name of <i>Terre d'Auvergne</i>. As the price of his concurrence with the
  king in this matter, the bishop of Clermont, Robert I. (1195-1227), was
  granted the lordship of the town of Clermont, which subsequently became a
  countship. Such was the origin of the four great historic lordships of
  Auvergne. The <i>Terre d'Auvergne</i> was first an appanage of Count
  Alphonse of Poitiers (1241-1271), and in 1360 was erected into a duchy in
  the peerage of France (duché-pairie) by King John II. in favour of his
  son John, through whose daughter the new title passed in 1416 to the
  house of Bourbon. The last duke, the celebrated constable Charles of
  Bourbon, united the domains of the <i>Dauphiné</i> to those of the <!--
  Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[v.03
  p.0050]</span>duchy, but all were confiscated by the crown in consequence
  of the sentence which punished the constable's treason in 1527. The
  countship, however, had passed in 1422 to the house of La Tour, and was
  not annexed to the domain until 1615. The administration of the royal
  province of Auvergne was organized under Louis XIV. At the time of the
  revolution it formed what was called a "government," with two divisions:
  Upper Auvergne (Aurillac), and Lower Auvergne (Clermont).</p>

  Constantine deposed the orthodox bishops who resisted, Auxentius was
  installed into the seat of Dionysius, bishop of Milan, and came to be
  regarded as the great opponent of the Nicene doctrine in the West. So
  prominent did he become, that he was specially mentioned by name in the
  condemnatory decree of the synod which Damasus, bishop of Rome, urged by
  Athanasius, convened in defence of the Nicene doctrine (<span

  <p><b>AUXERRE,</b> a town of central France, capital of the department of

  and Nevers. Pop. (1906) 16,971. It is situated on the slopes and the
  summit of an eminence on the left bank of the Yonne, which is crossed by
  two bridges leading to suburbs on the right bank. The town is irregularly
  built and its streets are steep and narrow, but it is surrounded by wide
  tree-lined boulevards, which have replaced the ancient fortifications,
  and has some fine churches. That of St Étienne, formerly the cathedral,
  is a majestic Gothic building of the 13th to the 16th centuries. It is
  entered by three richly sculptured portals, over the middle and largest
  of which is a rose window; over the north portal rises a massive tower,
  but that which should surmount the south portal is unfinished. The
  lateral entrances are sheltered by tympana and arches profusely decorated
  with statuettes. The plan consists of a nave, with aisles and lateral
  chapels, transept and choir, with a deambulatory at a slightly lower
  level. Beneath the choir, which is a fine example of early Gothic
  architecture, extends a crypt of the 11th century with mural paintings of
  the 12th century. The church has some fine stained glass and many
  pictures and other works of art. The ancient episcopal palace, now used
  as prefecture, stands behind the cathedral; it preserves a Romanesque
  gallery of the 12th century. The church of St Eusèbe belongs to the 12th,
  13th and 16th centuries. Of the abbey church of St Germain, built in the
  13th and 14th centuries, most of the nave has disappeared, so that its
  imposing Romanesque tower stands apart from it; crypts of the 9th century
  contain the tombs of bishops of Auxerre. The abbey was once fortified and
  a high wall and cylindrical tower remain. The buildings (18th century)
  are partly occupied by a hospital and a training college. The church of
  St Pierre, in the Renaissance style of the 16th and 17th centuries, is
  conspicuous for the elaborate ornamentation of its west façade. The old
  law-court contains the museum, with a collection of antiquities and
  paintings, and a library. In the middle of the town is a gateway
  surmounted by a belfry, dating from the 15th century. Auxerre has statues
  of Marshal Davout, J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;J. Fourier and Paul Bert, the two latter natives
  of the town. The town is the seat of a court of assizes and has tribunals
  of first instance and of commerce, and a branch of the Bank of France. A
  lycée for girls, a communal college and training colleges are among its
  educational establishments. Manufactures of ochre, of which there are
  quarries in the vicinity, and of iron goods are carried on. The canal of
  Nivernais reaches as far as Auxerre, which has a busy port and carries on
  boat-building. Trade is principally in the choice wine of the surrounding
  vineyards, and in timber and coal.</p>

  <p>Auxerre (<i>Autessiodurum</i>) became the seat of a bishop and a
  civitas in the 3rd century. Under the Merovingian kings the abbey of St
  Germain, named after the 6th bishop, was founded, and in the 9th century
  its schools had made the town a seat of learning. The bishopric was
  suppressed in 1790.</p>

  <p>The countship of Auxerre was granted by King Robert I. to his
  son-in-law Renaud, count of Nevers. It remained in the house of Nevers
  until 1184, when it passed by marriage to that of Courtenay. Other
  alliances transferred it successively to the families of Donzy,
  Châtillon, Bourbon and Burgundy. Alice of Burgundy, countess of Auxerre,
  married John of Châlons (d. 1309), and several counts of Auxerre
  belonging to the house of Châlons distinguished themselves in the wars
  against the English during the 14th century. John II., count of Auxerre,
  was killed at the battle of Crécy (1346), and his grandson, John IV.,
  sold his countship to King Charles V. in 1370.</p>

  <p><b>AUXILIARY</b> (from Lat. <i>auxilium</i>, help), that which gives
  aid or support; the term is used in grammar of a verb which completes the
  tense, mood or voice of another verb; in engineering, <i>e.g.</i> of the
  low steam power used to supplement the sail-power in sailing ships, still
  occasionally used in yachts, sealers or whalers; and in military use, of
  foreign or allied troops, more properly of any troops not permanently
  maintained under arms. In the British army the term "Auxiliary Forces"
  was employed formerly to include the Militia, the Imperial Yeomanry and
  the Volunteers.</p>

  <p><b>AUXIMUM</b> (mod. <i>Osimo</i>), an ancient town in Picenum,
  situated on an isolated hill 8 m. from the Adriatic, on the road from
  Ancona to Nuceria. It was selected by the Romans as a fortress to protect
  their settlements in northern Picenum, and strongly fortified in 174
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The walls erected at that period, of large
  rectangular blocks of stone, still exist in great part. Auximum became a
  colony at latest in 157 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> It often appears
  in the history of the civil wars, owing to its strong position. Pompey
  was its patron, and intended that Caesar should find resistance here in
  49 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> It appears to have been a place of some
  importance in imperial times, as inscriptions and the monuments of its
  forum (the present piazza) show. In the 6th century it is called by
  Procopius the chief town of Picenum, Ancona being spoken of as its
  harbour.</p>

  <p>(<span class="sc">T. As.</span>)</p>

  <p><b>AUXONNE,</b> a town of eastern France, in the department of Côte
  d'Or, 19 m. E.S.E. of Dijon on the Paris-Lyon railway to Belfort. Pop.
  (1906) 2766 (town); 6307 (commune). Auxonne is a quiet town situated in a
  wide plain on the left bank of the Saône. It preserves remains of
  ramparts, a stronghold of the 16th century flanked by cylindrical towers,
  and a sculptured gateway of the 15th century. Vauban restored these works
  in the latter half of the 17th century, and built the arsenal now used as
  a market. The church of Notre-Dame dates from the 14th century. Of the
  two towers surmounting its triple porch only that to the south is
  finished. A lofty spire rises above a third tower over the crossing. The
  hôtel de ville (15th century) and some houses of the Renaissance period
  are also of architectural interest. A statue of Napoleon I. as a
  sub-lieutenant commemorates his sojourns in the town from 1788 to 1791.
  Auxonne has a tribunal of commerce and a communal college. Its industries
  are unimportant, but it has a large trade in the vegetables produced by
  the numerous market gardens in the vicinity.</p>

  <p>Auxonne, the name of which is derived from its position on the Saône
  (<i>ad Sonam</i>), was in the middle ages chief place of a countship,
  which in the first half of the 13th century passed to the dukes of
  Burgundy. The town received a charter in 1229 and derived some importance
  from the mint which the dukes of Burgundy founded in it. It was invested
  by the allies in 1814, and surrendered to an Austrian force in the
  following year.</p>

  <p><b>AVA,</b> the ancient capital of the Burman empire, now a
  subdivision of the Sagaing district in the Sagaing division of Upper
  Burma. It is situated on the Irrawaddy on the opposite <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[v.03 p.0051]</span>bank to
  Sagaing, with which it was amalgamated in 1889. Amarapura, another
  ancient capital, lies 5 m. to the north-east of Ava, and Mandalay, the
  present capital, 6 m. to the north. The classical name of Ava is
  Yadanapura, "the city of precious gems." It was founded by Thadomin
  Pay&#x101; in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1364 as successor to Pagan,
  and the religious buildings of Pagan were to a certain extent reproduced
  here, although on nothing like the same scale as regards either size or
  splendour. It remained the seat of government for about four centuries
  with a succession of thirty kings. In 1782 a new capital, Amarapura, was
  founded by Bodaw Pay&#x101;, but was deserted again in favour of Ava by
  King Baggidaw in 1823. On his deposition by King Tharawaddi in 1837, the
  capital reverted to Amarapura; but finally in 1860 the last capital of
  Mandalay was occupied by King Mind&#x14D;n. For picturesque beauty Ava is
  unequalled in Burma, but it is now more like a park than the site of an
  old capital. Traces of the great council chamber and various portions of
  the royal palace are still visible, but otherwise the secular buildings
  are completely destroyed; and most of the religious edifices are also
  dilapidated.</p>

  <p><b>AVAD&#x100;NA,</b> the name given to a type of Buddhist romance
  literature represented by a large number of Sanskrit (Nepalese)
  collections, of which the chief are the Avad&#x101;nasataka (Century of
  Legends), and the Divy&#x101;vad&#x101;na (The Heavenly Legend). Though
  of later date than most of the canonical Buddhist books, they are held in
  veneration by the orthodox, and occupy much the same position with regard
  to Buddhism that the Pur&#x101;nas do towards Brahminism.</p>

  <p><b>AVAHI,</b> the native name of a Malagasy lemur (<i>Avahis
  laniger</i>) nearly allied to the indri (<i>q.v.</i>), and the smallest
  representative of the subfamily <i>Indrisinae</i>, characterized by its
  woolly coat, and measuring about 28 in. in length, of which rather more
  than half is accounted for by the tail. Unlike the other members of the
  group, the avahi is nocturnal, and does not associate in small troops,
  but is met with either alone or in pairs. Very slow in its movements, it
  rarely descends to the ground, but, when it does, walks upright like the
  other members of the group. It is found throughout the forests which
  clothe the mountains on the east coast of Madagascar, and also in a
  limited district on the northwest coast, the specimens from the latter
  locality being of smaller size and rather different in colour. The
  eastern phase is generally rusty red above, with the inner sides of the
  limbs white; while the predominant hue in the western form is usually
  yellowish brown. (See <span class="sc">Primates</span>.)</p>

  <p>(R. L.*)</p>

  <p><b>AVALANCHE</b> (adopted from a French dialectic form,
  <i>avalance</i>, descent), a mass of snow and ice mingled with earth and
  stones, which rushes down a mountain side, carrying everything before it,
  and producing a strong wind which uproots trees on each side of its
  course. Where the supply of snow exceeds the loss by evaporation the
  surplus descends the mountain sides, slowly in the form of glaciers, or
  suddenly in ice-falls or in avalanches. A mass of snow may accumulate
  upon a steep slope and become compacted into ice by pressure, or remain
  loosely aggregated. When the foundation gives way, owing to the loosening
  effect of spring rains or from any other cause, the whole mass slides
  downward. A very small cause will sometimes set a mass of overloaded snow
  in motion. Thunder or even a loud shout is said to produce this effect
  when the mass is just poised, and Swiss guides often enjoin absolute
  silence when crossing dangerous spots.</p>

  <p><b>AVALLON,</b> a town of central France, capital of an arrondissement
  in the department of Yonne, 34 m. S.S.E. of Auxerre on a branch of the
  Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) 5197. The town, with wide streets and
  picturesque promenades, is finely situated on a promontory, the base of
  which is washed on the south by the Cousin, on the east and west by small
  streams. Its chief building, the church of St Lazare, dates from the 12th
  century. The two western portals are adorned with sculpture in the ornate
  Romanesque style; the tower on the left of the façade was rebuilt in the
  17th century. The Tour de L'Horloge, pierced by a gateway through which
  passes the Grande Rue, is a 15th century structure containing a museum on
  its second floor. Remains of the ancient fortifications, including seven
  of the flanking towers, are still to be seen. Avallon has a statue of
  Vauban, the military engineer. The public institutions include the
  subprefecture, a tribunal of first instance, and a communal college. The
  manufacture of biscuits and gingerbread, and of leather and farm
  implements is carried on, and there is considerable traffic in wood,
  wine, and the live-stock and agricultural produce of the surrounding
  country.</p>

  <p>Avallon (<i>Aballo</i>) was in the middle ages the seat of a viscounty
  dependent on the duchy of Burgundy, and on the death of Charles the Bold
  passed under the royal authority.</p>

  <p><b>AVALON</b> (also written <span class="sc">Avallon, Avollon,
  Avilion</span> and <span class="sc">Avelion</span>), in Welsh mythology
  the kingdom of the dead, afterwards an earthly paradise in the western
  seas, and finally, in the Arthurian romances, the abode of heroes to
  which King Arthur was conveyed after his last battle. In Welsh the name
  is Ynys yr Afallon, usually interpreted "Isle of Apples," but possibly
  connected with the Celtic tradition of a king over the dead named Avalloc
  (in Welsh Afallach). If the traditional derivation is correct, the name
  is derived from the Welsh <i>afal</i>, an apple, and, as no other large
  fruit was well known to the races of northern Europe, is probably
  intended to symbolize the feasting and enjoyments of elysium. Other forms
  of the name are Ynysvitrin and Ynysgutrin, "Isle of Glass"&mdash;which
  appear to be identical with Glasberg, the Teutonic kingdom of the dead.
  Perhaps owing to a confusion between Glasberg or Ynysvitrin and the
  Anglo-Saxon Glaestinga-burh, Glastonbury, the name "Isle of Avalon" was
  given to the low ridge in central Somersetshire which culminates in
  Glastonbury Tor, while Glastonbury itself came to be called Avalon.
  Attempts have also been made to identify Avalon with other places in
  England and Wales.</p>

  <p><b>AVARAY,</b> a French territorial title belonging to a family some
  of whose members have been conspicuous in history. The Béarnaise family
  named Bésiade moved into the province of Orléanais in the 17th century,
  and there acquired the estate of Avaray. In 1667 Théophile de Bésiade,
  marquis d'Avaray, obtained the office of grand bailiff of Orleans, which
  was held by several of his descendants after him. Claude Antoine de
  Bésiade, marquis d'Avaray, was deputy for the bailliage of Orleans in the
  states-general of 1789, and proposed a <i>Declaration of the Duties of
  Man</i> as a pendant to the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man</i>; he
  subsequently became a lieutenant-general in 1814, a peer of France in
  1815, and duc d'Avaray in 1818. Antoine Louis François, comte d'Avaray,
  son of the above, distinguished himself during the Revolution by his
  devotion to the comte de Provence, afterwards Louis XVIII., whose
  emigration he assisted. Having nominally become king in 1799, that prince
  created the estate of Ile-Jourdain a duchy, under the title of Avaray, in
  favour of the comte d'Avaray, whom he termed his "liberator."</p>

  <p><b>AVARS,</b> or <span class="sc">Avari</span>, an East Caucasian
  people, the most renowned of the Lesghian tribes, inhabiting central
  Daghestan (see <span class="sc">Lesghians</span>). They are the only
  Lesghian tribe who possess a written language, for which they make use of
  the Arabic characters. They are often confused with the Avars whose
  empire on the Danube was broken by Charlemagne; but Komarov asserts that
  they are of more recent origin as a tribe, their name being Lowland Turki
  for "vagrant" or "refugee."</p>

  <p><b>AVATAR,</b> a Sanskrit word meaning "descent," specially used in
  Hindu mythology (and so in English) to express the incarnation of a deity
  visiting the earth for any purpose. The ten Avatars of Vishnu are the
  most famous. The Hindus believe he has appeared (1) as a fish, (2) as a
  tortoise, (3) as a hog, (4) as a monster, half man half lion, to destroy
  the giant Iranian, (5) as a dwarf, (6) as R&#x101;ma, (7) again as
  R&#x101;ma for the purpose of killing the thousand-armed giant
  Cartasuciriargunan, (8) as Krishna, (9) as Buddha. They allege that the
  tenth Avatar has yet to occur and will be in the form of a white-winged
  horse (Kalki) who will destroy the earth.</p>

  <p><b>AVEBURY, JOHN LUBBOCK,</b> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1834-
  ), English banker, politician and naturalist, was born in London <!--
  Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[v.03
  p.0052]</span>on the 30th of April 1834, the son of Sir John William
  Lubbock, 3rd baronet, himself a highly distinguished man of science. John
  Lubbock was sent to Eton in 1845; but three years later was taken into
  his father's bank, and became a partner at twenty-two. In 1865 he
  succeeded to the baronetcy. His love of science kept pace with his
  increasing participation in public affairs. He served on commissions upon
  coinage and other financial questions; and at the same time acted as
  president of the Entomological Society and of the Anthropological
  Institute. Early in his career several banking reforms of great
  importance were due to his initiative, while such works as <i>Prehistoric
  Times</i> (1865) and <i>The Origin of Civilization</i> (1870) were
  proceeding from his pen. In 1870, and again in 1874, he was elected a
  member of parliament for Maidstone. He lost the seat at the election of
  1880; but was at once elected member for London University, of which he
  had been vice-chancellor since 1872. He carried numerous enactments in
  parliament, including the Bank Holidays Act 1871, and bills dealing with
  absconding debtors, shop hours regulations, public libraries, open
  spaces, and the preservation of ancient monuments, and he proved himself
  an indefatigable and influential member of the Unionist party. A
  prominent supporter of the Statistical Society, he took an active part in
  criticizing the encroachment of municipal trading and the increase of the
  municipal debt. He was elected the first president of the Institute of
  Bankers in 1879; in 1881 he was president of the British Association, and
  from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnaean Society. He received honorary
  degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge (where he was Rede
  lecturer in 1886), Edinburgh, Dublin and Würzburg; and in 1878 was
  appointed a trustee of the British Museum. From 1888 to 1892 he was
  president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890
  vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County
  Council. During the same period he served on royal commissions on
  education and on gold and silver. In 1890 he was appointed a privy
  councillor; and was chairman of the committee of design on the new
  coinage in 1891. In 1900 he was raised to the peerage, under the title of
  Baron Avebury, and he continued to play a leading part in public life,
  not only by the weight of his authority on many subjects, but by the
  readiness with which he lent his support to movements for the public
  benefit. Among other matters he was a prominent advocate of proportional
  representation. As an original author and a thoughtful popularizer of
  natural history and philosophy he had few rivals in his day, as is
  evidenced by the number of editions issued of many of his writings, among
  which the most widely-read have been: <i>The Origin and Metamorphoses of
  Insects</i> (1873), <i>British Wild Flowers</i> (1875), <i>Ants, Bees and
  Wasps</i> (1882), <i>Flowers, Fruit and Leaves</i> (1886), <i>The
  Pleasures of Life</i> (1887), <i>The Senses, Instincts and Intelligence
  of Animals</i> (1888), <i>The Beauties of Nature</i> (1892), <i>The Use
  of Life</i> (1894).</p>

  <p><b>AVEBURY,</b> a village in the Devizes parliamentary division of
  Wiltshire, England, on the river Kennet, 8 m. by road from Marlborough.
  The fine church of St James contains an early font with Norman carving, a
  rich Norman doorway, a painted reredos, and a beautiful old roodstone in
  good preservation. Avebury House is Elizabethan, with a curious stone
  dovecot. The village has encroached upon the remains of a huge stone
  circle (not quite circular), surrounded by a ditch and rampart of earth,
  and once approached by two avenues of monoliths. Within the larger circle
  were two smaller ones, placed not in the axis of the great one but on its
  north-eastern side, each of which consisted of a double concentric ring
  of stones; the centre being in one case a menhir or pillar, in the other
  a dolmen or tablestone resting on two uprights. Few traces remain, as the
  monoliths have been largely broken up for building purposes. The circle
  is the largest specimen of primitive stone monuments in Britain,
  measuring on the average 1200 ft. in diameter. The stones are all the
  native Sarsens which occur everywhere in the district, and show no
  evidence of having been hewn. Those still remaining vary in size from 5
  to 20 ft. in height above ground, and from 3 to 12 ft. in breadth. As in
  the case of Stonehenge, the purpose for which the Avebury monument was
  erected has been the source of much difference of opinion among
  antiquaries, Dr Stukely (<i>Stonehenge a Temple restored to the British
  Druids</i>, 1740) regarding it as a Druidical temple, while Fergusson
  (<i>Rude Stone Monuments</i>, 1872) believed that it, as well as Silbury
  Hill, marks the site of the graves of those who fell in the last
  Arthurian battle at Badon Hill (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 520). The
  majority of antiquaries, however, see no reason for dissociating its
  chronological horizon from that of the numerous other analogous monuments
  found in Great Britain, many of which have been shown to be burial places
  of the Bronze Age. Excavations were carried out here in 1908, but without
  throwing any important new light on the monument.</p>

  <p>There are many barrows on the neighbouring downs, besides traces of a
  double oval of monoliths on Hackpen hill, and the huge mound of Silbury
  Hill. Waden Hill, to the south, has been, like Badbury, identified with
  Badon Hill, which was the traditional scene of the twelfth and last great
  battle of King Arthur in 520. The Roman road from Winchester to Bath
  skirts the south side of Silbury Hill.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Domesday Survey, the church of Avebury (Avreberie,
  Abury), with two hides attached, was held in chief by Rainbold, a priest,
  and was bestowed by Henry III. on the abbot and monks of Cirencester, who
  continued to hold it until the reign of Henry VIII. The manor of Avebury
  was granted in the reign of Henry I. to the Benedictine monks of St
  George of Boucherville in Normandy, and a cell from that abbey was
  subsequently established here. In consequence of the war with France in
  the reign of Edward III., this manor was annexed by the crown, and was
  conferred on the newly founded college of New College, Oxford, together
  with all the possessions, spiritual and temporal, of the priory.</p>

  <p><b>AVEIA,</b> an ancient town of the Vestini, on the Via Claudia Nova,
  6 m. S.E. of Aquila, N.E. of the modern village of Fossa. Some remains of
  ancient buildings still exist, and the name Aveia still clings to the
  place. The identification was first made by V.&nbsp;M. Giovenazzi, <i>Della
  Città di Aveia ne' Vestini</i> (Rome, 1773). Paintings in the church of
  S. Maria ad Cryptas, of the 12th to 15th centuries, are important in the
  history of art. An inscription of a <i>stationarius</i> of the 3rd
  century, sent here on special duty (no doubt for the suppression of
  brigandage), was found here in 1902 (A. von Domaszewski, <i>Röm.
  Mitt.</i>, 1902, 330).</p>

  <p><b>AVEIRO,</b> a seaport, episcopal see, and the capital of an
  administrative district, formerly included in the province of Beira,
  Portugal; on the river Vouga, and the Lisbon-Oporto railway. Pop. (1900)
  9979. Aveiro is built on the southern shore of a marshy lagoon,
  containing many small islands, and measuring about 15 m. from north to
  south, with an average breadth of about 1 m. The Barra Nova, an
  artificial canal about 33 ft. deep, was constructed between 1801 and
  1808, and gives access to the Atlantic ocean. The local industries
  include the preparation of sea-salt, the catching and curing of fish,
  especially sardines and oysters, and the gathering of aquatic plants
  (<i>moliço</i>). There is also a brisk trade in wine, oil and fruit;
  while the Aveiro district contains copper and lead mines, besides much
  good pasture-land.</p>

  <p>Aveiro is probably the Roman Talabriga. In the 16th century it was the
  birthplace of João Affonso, one of the first navigators to visit the
  fishing-grounds of Newfoundland; and it soon became famous for its fleet
  of more than sixty vessels, which sailed yearly to that country, and
  returned laden with dried codfish. During the same century the cathedral
  was built, and the city was made a duchy. The title "duke of Aveiro"
  became extinct when its last holder, Dom José Mascarenhas e Lancaster,
  was burned alive for high treason, in 1759. The administrative district
  of Aveiro coincides with the north-western part of the province of Beira;
  pop. (1900) 303,169; area, 1065 sq. m.</p>

  <p><b>AVELLA</b> (anc. <i>Abella</i>), a city of Campania, Italy, in the
  province of Avellino, 23 m. N.E. of Naples by rail. Pop. (1901) 4107. It
  is finely situated in fertile territory and its nuts (<i>nuces
  Abellanae</i>) and fruit were renowned in Roman days. About 2 m. to the
  north-east lies Avella Vecchia, the ancient Abella, regarded <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[v.03 p.0053]</span>by the
  ancients as a Chalcidian colony. An important Oscan inscription relates
  to a treaty with Nola, regarding a joint temple of Hercules, attributable
  to the 2nd century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Under the early empire
  it had already become a colony and had perhaps been one since the time of
  Sulla. It has remains of the walls of the citadel and of an amphitheatre,
  and lay on the road from Nola to Abellinum, which was here perhaps joined
  by a branch from Suessula.</p>

  <p><b>AVELLINO,</b> a city and episcopal see of Campania, Italy, the
  capital of the province of Avellino, 1150 ft. above sea-level, 28 m.
  direct and 59 m. by rail E.N.E. of Naples, at the foot of Monte Vergine.
  Pop. (1901) 23,760. There are ruins of the castle constructed in the 9th
  or 10th century, in which the antipope Anacletus II. crowned Count Roger
  II. king of Sicily and Apulia. Avellino is the junction of lines to
  Benevento and Rocchetta S. Antonio. The name is derived from the ancient
  Abellinum, the ruins of which lie 2½ m. north-east, close to the village
  of Atripalda, and consist of remains of city walls and an amphitheatre in
  <i>opus reticulatum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of the early imperial period, when
  Abellinum appears to have been the chief place of a tribe, to which
  belonged also the independent communities of the <i>Abellinates cognomine
  Protropi</i> among the Hirpini, and the <i>Abellinates cognominati
  Marsi</i> among the Apulians (Nissen, <i>Italische Landeskunde</i>, ii.
  822). It lay on the boundary of Campania and the territory of the
  Hirpini, at the junction of the roads from Nola (and perhaps also from
  Suessula) and Salernum to Beneventum.</p>

  <p>The Monte Vergine (4165 ft.) lies 4 m. to the N.W. of Avellino; upon
  the summit is a sanctuary of the Virgin, founded in 1119, which contains
  a miraculous picture attributed to S. Luke (the greatest festival is on
  the 8th of September). The present church is baroque in style, but
  contains some works of art of earlier periods. The important archives
  have been transported to Naples.</p>

  &#x1E62;a&#x201B;igh</span>, <i>i.e.</i> son of the goldsmith, the name
  being corrupted by the Latins into Avempace, Avenpace or Aben Pace], the
  earliest and one of the most distinguished of the Arab philosophers of
  Spain. Little is known of the details of his life. He was born probably
  at Saragossa towards the close of the 11th century. According to Ibn
  Kh&#x101;q&#x101;n, a contemporary writer, he became a student of the
  exact sciences and was also a musician and a poet. But he was a
  philosopher as well, and apparently a sceptic. He is said to have
  rejected the Koran, to have denied the return to God, and to have
  regarded death as the end of existence. But even in that orthodox age he
  became vizier to the amir of Murcia. Afterwards he went to Valencia, then
  to Saragossa. After the fall of Saragossa (1119) he went to Seville, then
  to Xativa, where he is said to have returned to Islam to save his life.
  Finally he retired to the Almoravid court at Fez, where he was poisoned
  in 1138. Ibn &#x201B;Usaibi&#x201B;a gives a list of twenty-five of his
  works, but few of these remain. He had a distinct influence upon Averroes
  (see <span class="sc">Arabian Philosophy</span>).</p>

  <p><b>AVENARIUS, RICHARD HEINRICH LUDWIG</b> (1843-1896), German
  philosopher, was born in Paris on the 19th of November 1843. His
  education, begun in Zürich and Berlin, was completed at the university of
  Leipzig, where he graduated in 1876. In 1877 he became professor of
  philosophy in Zürich, where he died on the 18th of August 1896. At
  Leipzig he was one of the founders of the <i>Akademisch-philosophische
  Verein</i>, and was the first editor of the <i>Vierteljahrsschrift für
  wissenschaftliche Philosophie</i>. In 1868 he published an essay on the
  Pantheism of Spinoza. His chief works are <i>Philosophie als Denken der
  Welt gemäss dem Princip des kleinsten Kraftmasses</i> (1876) and the
  <i>Kritik der reinen Erfahrung</i> (1888-1890). In these works he made an
  attempt to co-ordinate thought and action. Like Mach, he started from the
  principle of economy of thinking, and in the <i>Kritik</i> endeavoured to
  explain pure experience in relation to knowledge and environment. He
  discovers that statements dependent upon environment constitute pure
  experience. This philosophy, called Empirio-criticism, is not, however, a
  realistic but an idealistic dualism, nor can it be called
  materialism.</p>

  <p><b>AVENGER OF BLOOD,</b> the person, usually the nearest kinsman of
  the murdered man, whose duty it was to avenge his death by killing the
  murderer. In primitive societies, before the evolution of settled
  government, or the uprise of a systematized criminal law, crimes of
  violence were regarded as injuries of a personal character to be punished
  by the sufferer or his kinsfolk. This right of vengeance was common to
  most countries, and in many was the subject of strict regulations and
  limitations. It was prevented from running into excesses by the law of
  sanctuary (<i>q.v.</i>) and in many lands the institution of blood-money,
  and the wergild offered the wrong-doer a mode of escaping from his
  enemies' revenge. The Mosaic law recognized the right of vengeance, but
  not the money-compensation. The Koran, on the contrary, while sanctioning
  the vengeance, also permits pecuniary commutation for murder.</p>

  <p><b>AVENGERS,</b> or <span class="sc">Vendicatori</span>, a secret
  society formed about 1186 in Sicily to avenge popular wrongs. The society
  was finally suppressed by King William II., the Norman, who hanged the
  grand master and branded the members with hot irons.</p>

  <p><b>AVENTAIL,</b> or <span class="sc">Avantaille</span> (O. Fr.
  <i>esventail</i>, presumably from a Latin word <i>exventaculum</i>,
  air-hole), the mouthpiece of an old-fashioned helmet, movable to admit
  the air.</p>

  <p><b>AVENTINUS</b> (1477-1534), the name taken by <span
  class="sc">Johann Turmair</span>, author of the <i>Annales Boiorum</i>,
  or <i>Annals of Bavaria</i>, from Aventinum, the Latin name of the town
  of Abensberg, where he was born on the 4th of July 1477. Having studied
  at Ingolstadt, Vienna, Cracow and Paris, he returned to Ingolstadt in
  1507, and in 1509 was appointed tutor to Louis and Ernest, the two
  younger sons of Albert the Wise, the late duke of Bavaria-Munich. He
  retained this position until 1517, wrote a Latin grammar, and other
  manuals for the use of his pupils, and in 1515 travelled in Italy with
  Ernest. Encouraged by William IV., duke of Bavaria, he began to write the
  <i>Annales Boiorum</i>, about 1517, and finishing this book in 1521,
  undertook a German version of it, entitled <i>Bayersche Chronik</i>,
  which he completed some years later. He assisted to found the
  <i>Sodalitas litteraria Angilostadensis</i>, under the auspices of which
  several old manuscripts were brought to light. Although Aventinus did not
  definitely adopt the reformed faith, he sympathized with the reformers
  and their teaching, and showed a strong dislike for the monks. On this
  account he.was imprisoned in 1528, but his friends soon effected his
  release. The remainder of his life was somewhat unsettled, and he died at
  Regensburg on the 9th of January 1534. The <i>Annales</i>, which are in
  seven books, deal with the history of Bavaria in conjunction with general
  history from the earliest times to 1460, and the author shows a strong
  sympathy for the Empire in its struggle with the Papacy. He took immense
  pains with his work, and to some degree anticipated the modern scientific
  method of writing history. The <i>Annales</i> were first published in
  1554, but many important passages were omitted in this edition, as they
  reflected on the Roman Catholics. A more complete edition was published
  at Basel in 1580 by Nicholas Cisner. Aventinus, who has been called the
  "Bavarian Herodotus," wrote other books of minor importance, and a
  complete edition of his works was published at Munich (1881-1886). More
  recently a new edition (six vols.) has appeared.</p>

  <p><b>AVENTURINE,</b> or <span class="sc">Avanturine</span>, a variety of
  quartz containing spangles of mica or scales of iron-oxide, which confer
  brilliancy on the stone. It is found chiefly in the Ural Mountains, and
  is cut for ornamental purposes at Ekaterinburg. Some of the Siberian
  aventurine, like that of the vase given by Nicholas I. to Sir R.
  Murchison, in 1843, is a micaceous iron-stained quartz, of but little
  beauty. Most aventurine is of reddish brown or yellow colour, but a green
  variety, containing scales of fuchsite or chrome-mica, is also known.
  This green aventurine, highly valued by the Chinese, is said to occur in
  the Bellary district in India.</p>

  <p>Aventurine felspar, known also as Sun-stone (<i>q.v.</i>) is found
  principally at Tvedestrand in south Norway, and is a variety of
  oligoclase enclosing micaceous scales of haematite. Other kinds of
  felspar, even orthoclase, may however also show the aventurine
  appearance. Both plagioclastic and orthoclastic aventurine occur at
  several localities in the United States.</p>

  <p>The mineral aventurine takes its name from the well-known
  aventurine-glass of Venice. This is a reddish brown glass with gold-like
  spangles, more brilliant than most of the natural stone. The story runs
  that this kind of glass was originally made accidentally at Murano by a
  workman, who let some copper filings fall into the molten "metal," whence
  the product was called <i>avventurino</i>. From the Murano glass the name
  passed to the mineral, which displayed a rather similar appearance.</p>

  <p><b>AVENUE</b> (the past participle feminine of Fr. <i>avenir</i>, to
  come to), a way of approach; more particularly, the chief entrance-road
  to a country house, with rows of trees on each side; the trees themselves
  are said to form the avenue. In modern times the word has been much used
  as a name for streets in towns, whether with or without trees, such as
  Fifth Avenue in New York, or Shaftesbury Avenue in London.</p>

  <p><b>AVENZOAR,</b> or <span class="sc">Abumeron</span> [Ab&#x16B;
  Merw&#x101;n &#x201B;Abdal-Malik ibn Zuhr], Arabian physician, who
  flourished at the beginning of the 12th century, was born at Seville,
  where he exercised his profession with great reputation. His ancestors
  had been celebrated as physicians for several generations, and his son
  was afterwards held by the Arabians to be even more eminent in his
  profession than Avenzoar himself. He was a contemporary of Averroes, who,
  according to Leo Africanus, heard his lectures, and learned physic of
  him. He belonged, in many respects, to the <i>Dogmatists</i> or
  <i>Rational School</i>, rather than to the <i>Empirics</i>. He was a
  great admirer of Galen; and in his writings he protests emphatically
  against quackery and the superstitious remedies of the astrologers. He
  shows no inconsiderable knowledge of anatomy in his remarkable
  description of inflammation and abscess of the mediastinum in his own
  person, and its diagnosis from common pleuritis as well as from abscess
  and dropsy of the pericardium. In cases of obstruction or of palsy of the
  gullet, his three modes of treatment are ingenious. He proposes to
  support the strength by placing the patient in a tepid bath of nutritious
  liquids, that might enter by cutaneous imbibition, but does not recommend
  this. He speaks more favourably of the introduction of food into the
  stomach by a silver tube; and he strongly recommends the use of nutritive
  enemata. From his writings it would appear that the offices of physician,
  surgeon and apothecary were already considered as distinct professions.
  He wrote a book entitled <i>The Method of Preparing Medicines and
  Diet</i>, which was translated into Hebrew in the year 1280, and thence
  into Latin by Paravicius, whose version, first printed at Venice, 1490,
  has passed through several editions.</p>

  <p><b>AVERAGE,</b> a term found in two main senses. (1) The first, which
  occurs in old law, is from a Law-Latin <i>averagium</i>, and is connected
  with the Domesday Book <i>avera</i>, the "day's work which the king's
  tenants gave to the sheriff"; it is supposed to be a form of the O. Fr.
  <i>ovre</i> (<i>&oelig;uvre</i>), work, affected by <i>aver</i>, the O.
  Eng. word for cattle or property, but the etymology is uncertain. As
  meaning some form of feudal service rendered by tenants to their
  superiors, it survived for a long time in the Scottish phrase "arriage
  and carriage," this form of the word being due to a contraction into
  "arage." (2) The second word, which represents the modern usages, is also
  uncertain in its derivation, but corresponded with the Fr. <i>avarie</i>,
  and was early spelt "averays," recurring also as "avaria," "averia," and
  meaning a certain tax on goods, and then more precisely in maritime law
  any charge additional to "freight" (see <span
  class="sc">Affreightment</span>), payable by the owner of goods sent by
  ship. Hence the modern employment of the term for <i>particular</i> and
  <i>general</i> average (see below) in marine insurance. The essential of
  equitable distribution, involved in this sense, was transferred to give
  the word "average" its more colloquial meaning of an equalization of
  amount, or medium among various quantities, or nearest common rate or
  figure. (For a discussion of the etymology, see the <i>New English
  Dictionary</i>, especially the concluding note with reference to
  authorities.)</p>

  <p><i>In Shipping.</i>&mdash;Average, in modern law, is the term used in
  maritime commerce to signify damages or expenses resulting from the
  accidents of navigation. Average is either <i>general</i> or
  <i>particular</i>. General average arises when sacrifices have been made,
  or expenditures incurred, for the preservation of the ship, cargo and
  freight, from some peril of the sea or from its effects. It implies a
  subsequent contribution, from all the parties concerned, rateably to the
  values of their respective interests, to make good the loss thus
  occasioned. Particular average signifies the damage or partial loss
  happening to the ship, goods, or freight by some fortuitous or
  unavoidable accident. It is borne by the parties to whose property the
  misfortune happens or by their insurers. The term average originally
  meant what is now distinguished as general average; and the expression
  "particular average," although not strictly accurate, came to be
  afterwards used for the convenience of distinguishing those damages or
  partial losses for which no general contribution could be claimed.</p>

  <p>Although nothing can be more simple than the fundamental principle of
  general average, that a loss incurred for the advantage of all the
  coadventurers should be made good by them all in equitable proportion to
  their stakes in the adventure, the application of this principle to the
  varied and complicated cases which occur in the course of maritime
  commerce has given rise to many diversities of usage at different periods
  and in different countries. It is soon discovered that the principle
  cannot be applied in any settled or consistent manner unless by the aid
  of rules of a technical and sometimes of a seemingly arbitrary character.
  The difficulty, which at one time seemed nearly insuperable, of bringing
  together the rules in force in the several maritime countries, has been
  to a large extent overcome&mdash;not by legislation but by framing a set
  of rules covering the principal points of difference in such a manner as
  to satisfy, on the whole, those who are practically concerned, and to
  lead them to adopt these <span class="sidenote">History of the
  York-Antwerp rules.</span> rules in their contracts of affreightment and
  contracts of insurance (see <span class="sc">Insurance</span>:
  <i>Marine</i>). The honour of the achievement belongs to a small number
  of men who recognized the need of uniformity. The work began in May 1860
  at the congress held at Glasgow, under the presidency of Lord Brougham,
  assisted by Lord Neaves. Further congresses were held in London (1862),
  and at York (1864), when a body of rules known as the "York Rules" was
  agreed to. There the matter stood, until it was taken up by the
  "Association for the Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations" at
  conferences held at the Hague (1875), Bremen (1876) and Antwerp (1877).
  Some changes were made in the "York Rules"; and so altered, the body of
  rules was adopted at the last-named conference, and was styled the "York
  and Antwerp (or York-Antwerp) Rules." The value of these rules was
  quickly perceived, and practical use of them followed. But they proved to
  be insufficient, or unsatisfactory, on some points; and again, in the
  autumn of 1890, a conference on the subject was held, this time at
  Liverpool, by the same Association, under the able presidency of Dr F.
  Sieveking, president of the Hanseatic High Court of Appeal at Hamburg.
  Important changes were then made, carrying further certain departures
  from English law, already apparent in the earlier rules, in favour of
  views prevailing upon the continent of Europe and in the United States.
  The new rules were styled the <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[v.03 p.0055]</span>York-Antwerp Rules 1890. In
  practice they quickly displaced those of 1877; and in 1892, at a
  conference of the same Association held at Genoa, it was formally
  declared that the only international rules of general average having the
  sanction and authority of the association were the York-Antwerp Rules as
  revised in 1890, and that the original rules were rescinded. It is this
  later body of rules which is now known as the York-Antwerp Rules.
  Reference is now to be found in most English contracts of carriage and
  contracts of insurance, to these rules, as intended to govern the
  adjustment of G.A. between the parties; with the result that (so far as
  the rules cover the ground) adjustments do not depend upon the law of the
  place of destination, and so do not vary according to the destination, or
  the place at which the voyage may happen to be broken up, as used
  formerly to be the case.</p>

  <p>The rules are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule I.&mdash;Jettison of Deck Cargo</span></p>

  <p>No jettison of deck cargo shall be made good as G.A.</p>

  <p>Every structure not built in with the frame of the vessel shall be
  considered to be a part of the deck of the vessel.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule II.&mdash;Damage by Jettison and Sacrifice for the Common Safety</span></p>

  <p>Damage done to a ship and cargo, or either of them, by or in
  consequence of a sacrifice made for the common safety, and by water which
  goes down a ship's hatches opened, or other opening made for the purpose
  of making a jettison for the common safety, shall be made good as
  G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule III.&mdash;Extinguishing Fire on Shipboard</span></p>

  <p>Damage done to a ship and cargo, or either of them, by water or
  otherwise, including damage by beaching or scuttling a burning ship, in
  extinguishing a fire on board the ship, shall be made good as G.A.;
  except that no compensation shall be made for damage to such portions of
  the ship and bulk cargo, or to such separate packages of cargo, as have
  been on fire.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule IV.&mdash;Cutting away Wreck</span></p>

  <p>Loss or damage caused by cutting away the wreck or remains of spars,
  or of other things which have previously been carried away by sea-peril,
  shall not be made good as G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule V.&mdash;Voluntary Stranding</span></p>

  <p>When a ship is intentionally run on shore, and the circumstances are
  such that if that course were not adopted she would inevitably sink, or
  drive on shore or on rocks, no loss or damage caused to the ship, cargo
  and freight, or any of them, by such intentional running on shore, shall
  be made good as G.A. But in all other cases where a ship is intentionally
  run on shore for the common safety, the consequent loss or damage shall
  be allowed as G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule VI.&mdash;Carrying Press of Sail&mdash;Damage to or Loss of Sails</span></p>

  <p>Damage to or loss of sails and spars, or either of them, caused by
  forcing a ship off the ground or by driving her higher up the ground, for
  the common safety, shall be made good as G.A.; but where a ship is
  afloat, no loss or damage caused to the ship, cargo and freight, or any
  of them, by carrying a press of sail, shall be made good as G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule VII.&mdash;Damage to Engines in Refloating a Ship</span></p>

  <p>Damage caused to machinery and boilers of a ship which is ashore and
  in a position of peril, in endeavouring to refloat, shall be allowed in
  G.A., when shown to have arisen from an actual intention to float the
  ship for the common safety at the risk of such damage.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule VIII.&mdash;Expenses of Lightening a Ship when Ashore, and Consequent Damage</span></p>

  <p>When a ship is ashore, and, in order to float her, cargo, bunker coals
  and ship's stores, or any of them, are discharged, the extra cost of
  lightening, lighter hire, and reshipping (if incurred), and the loss or
  damage sustained thereby, shall be admitted as G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule IX.&mdash;Cargo, Ship's Materials, and Stores Burnt for Fuel</span></p>

  <p>Cargo, ship's materials and stores, or any of them, necessarily burnt
  for fuel for the common safety at a time of peril, shall be admitted as
  G.A., when and only when an ample supply of fuel had been provided; but
  the estimated quantity of coals that would have been consumed, calculated
  at the price current at the ship's last port of departure at the date of
  her leaving, shall be charged to the shipowner and credited to the
  G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule X.&mdash;Expenses at Port of Refuge</span>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) When a ship shall have entered a port or place of refuge,
  or shall have returned to her port or place of loading, in consequence of
  accident, sacrifice, or other extraordinary circumstances, which render
  that necessary for the common safety, the expenses of entering such port
  or place shall be admitted as G.A.; and when she shall have sailed thence
  with her original cargo, or a part of it, the corresponding expenses of
  leaving such port or place, consequent upon such entry or return, shall
  likewise be admitted as G.A.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The cost of discharging cargo from a ship, whether at a
  port or place of loading, call or refuge, shall be admitted as G.A., when
  the discharge was necessary for the common safety or to enable damage to
  the ship, caused by sacrifice or accident during the voyage, to be
  repaired, if the repairs were necessary for the safe prosecution of the
  voyage.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Whenever the cost of discharging cargo from a ship is
  admissible as G.A., the cost of reloading and storing such cargo on board
  the said ship, together with all storage charges on such cargo, shall
  likewise be so admitted. But when the ship is condemned or does not
  proceed on her original voyage, no storage expenses incurred after the
  date of the ship's condemnation or of the abandonment of the voyage shall
  be admitted as G.A.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) If a ship under average be in a port or place at which it
  is practicable to repair her, so as to enable her to carry on the whole
  cargo, and if, in order to save expenses, either she is towed thence to
  some other port or place of repair or to her destination, or the cargo or
  a portion of it is transhipped by another ship, or otherwise forwarded,
  then the extra cost of such towage, transhipment and forwarding, or any
  of them (up to the amount of the extra expense saved), shall be payable
  by the several parties to the adventure in proportion to the
  extraordinary expense saved.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule XI.&mdash;Wages and Maintenance of Crew in Port of Refuge</span>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>When a ship shall have entered or shall have been detained in any port
  or place under the circumstances, or for the purposes of the repairs,
  mentioned in Rule X., the wages payable to the master, officers and crew,
  together with the cost of maintenance of the same, during the extra
  period of detention in such port or place until the ship shall or should
  have been made ready to proceed upon her voyage, shall be admitted as
  G.A. But when this ship is condemned or does not proceed on her original
  voyage, the wages and maintenance of the master, officers and crew,
  incurred after the date of the ship's condemnation or of the abandonment
  of the voyage, shall not be admitted as G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule XII.&mdash;Damage to Cargo in Discharging</span>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Damage done to or loss of cargo necessarily caused in the act of
  discharging, storing, reloading and stowing shall be made good as G.A.
  when and only when the cost of those measures respectively is admitted as
  G.A.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Rule XIII.&mdash;Deductions from Cost of Repairs</span></p>

  <p>In adjusting claims for G.A., repairs to be allowed in G.A. shall be

  <p>The above rules differ in some important respects from English common
  law, and from former English practice. They follow ideas upon the subject
  of G.A. which have prevailed in practice in foreign countries (though
  often in apparent opposition to the language of the codes), in preference
  to the more strict principle of the common law applied by English courts.
  That principle requires that, in order to have the character of G.A. a
  sacrifice or expenditure must be made for the common <i>safety</i> of the
  several interests in the adventure and under the pressure of a common
  risk. It is not enough that the sacrifice or expenditure is prudent, or
  even necessary to enable the common adventure to be completed. G.A., on
  the English view, only arises where the <i>safety</i> of the several
  interests is at stake. "The idea of a common commercial adventure, as
  distinguished from the common safety from the sea," is not recognized. It
  is not sufficient "that an expenditure should have been made to benefit
  both cargo owner and shipowner."<a name="FnAnchor_031"
  href="#Footnote_031"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus expenses incurred after ship and cargo are in safety, say at
  <span class="sidenote">Port of refuge expenses.</span> a port of refuge,
  are not generally, by English law, to be treated as G.A.; although the
  putting into port may have been for safety, and therefore a G.A. act. If
  the putting into port has been necessitated by a G.A. sacrifice, as by
  cutting away the ship's masts, the case is different; the port expenses,
  the expenses of repairing the G.A. damage, and the incidental expenses of
  unloading, storing and reloading the cargo are, in such a case, treated
  as consequences of the original sacrifice, and therefore subjects for
  contribution. But where the reason for putting in is to avoid some
  danger, such as a storm or hostile cruiser, or to effect repairs
  necessitated by some <i>accidental</i> damage to the ship, the G.A.
  sacrifice is considered to be at an end when the port has been reached,
  if the ship and cargo are then in physical safety. The subsequent
  expenditure in the port is said not to flow from that sacrifice, but from
  the necessity of completing the voyage, and is incurred in performance of
  the shipowner's obligation under his contract. The practice of English
  average adjusters has indeed modified this strict view by treating the
  expense of <i>unloading</i> as G.A.; but it may well be doubted whether
  that practice can be legally supported. Moreover, expenditure in the port
  which is incurred in protecting the cargo as in warehousing it, is by
  English practice treated as a charge to be borne by the cargo for whose
  benefit it was incurred.</p>

  <p>If we turn now to York-Antwerp Rule X., it will be seen that a much
  broader view is adopted. Whatever the reason for putting into the port of
  refuge, provided it was necessary for the common safety, the expenses of
  going in, and the consequent expenses of getting out (if she sails again
  with all or part of her original cargo), are allowed as G.A., Rule X.
  (<i>a</i>). Further, the cost of discharging the cargo to enable damage
  to the ship to be repaired, whether caused by sacrifice or by accident
  during the voyage, is to be allowed as G.A., "if the repairs were
  necessary for the safe prosecution of the voyage," Rule X. (<i>b</i>).
  And that is to be so even where such repairs are done at a port of
  <i>call</i>, as well as where done at a port of <i>refuge</i>. Again,
  when the cost of discharging is treated as G.A., so also are to be the
  expenses of storing the cargo on shore, and of reloading and stowing it
  on board, after the repairs have been done (Rule X. (<i>c</i>)), together
  with any damage or loss incidental to those operations (Rule XII.).</p>

  <p>Further, by Rule XI. the wages of the master, officers and crew, and
  the cost of their maintenance, during the detention of a ship under the
  circumstances, or for the purpose of the repairs mentioned in Rule X.,
  are to be allowed in G.A. It is questionable whether English law allows
  the wages and maintenance of the crew at a port of refuge in any case.
  Where the detention is to repair <i>accidental</i> damage it seems clear
  that they are not allowed. And in practice under common law, the
  allowance is never made; so that Rule XI. is an important concession to
  the shipowner. Like the changes introduced by Rule X., it is a change
  towards the practice in foreign countries.</p>

  <p>It may be noted that the rules do not afford equal protection to a
  shipper in the comparatively infrequent case of his being put to expense
  by the delay at a port of refuge. Thus a shipper of cattle is not
  entitled to have the extra wages and provisions of his cattlemen on
  board, nor the extra fodder consumed by the cattle during the stay at a
  repairing port, made as good as G.A. under Rules XI. and X.
  (<i>Anglo-Argentine &amp;c. Agency</i> v. <i>Temperley Shipping Co.</i>,
  1899, 2 Q.B. 403).</p>

  <p>As to the acts which amount to G.A. sacrifices, as distinguished <span
  class="sidenote">General average sacrifices.</span> from expenditures,
  the York-Antwerp Rules do not much alter English common law. They do,
  however, make definite provisions upon some points on which authority was
  scanty or doubtful. (See Rules I.-IX.) And in Rule I., as to jettison of
  deck cargo, a change is made from the common law rule, for the jettison
  is not allowed as G.A. even though the cargo be carried on deck in
  accordance with an established custom of the particular trade.</p>

  <p>Rule III. deals with damage done in extinguishing fire on board a
  ship. Modern decisions have cleared away the old doubts whether such
  damage to ship or cargo should, at law, be allowed in G.A. But recent
  cases in the United States have raised the question whether the allowance
  should be made where the fire occurs in port, and is extinguished, not by
  the master, but by a public authority acting in the interests of the
  public. The Supreme Court of the United States decided against the
  allowance in 1894 in a case of <i>Ralli</i> v. <i>Troup</i> (157 U.S.
  386). The ship had there been scuttled to put out a fire on board, by the
  port authority, acting upon their own judgment, but with the assent of
  the master. It was held that the damage suffered by ship and cargo ought
  not to be made good by G.A. contributions; for the sacrifice had not been
  made "by some one specially charged with the control and safety of that
  adventure," but was the compulsory act of a public authority. On the
  other hand, in the English case of <i>Papayanni</i> v. <i>Grampian S.S.
  Co.</i> (I. Com. Ca. 448), Mathew, J., held that the scuttling of a ship
  at a port of refuge in Algeria, by orders of the captain of the port, was
  a G.A. act. It had been done in the interest of ship and cargo, and there
  was no evidence of any other motive.</p>

  <p>Rule V. deals with the question whether, and under what conditions, a
  voluntary stranding of the ship is a G.A. act, in a manner which will
  probably be held to express the law in England when the matter comes up
  for decision.</p>

  <p>Rules VI. and VII. deal with the damage sustained by the ship, or her
  appliances, in efforts to force her off the ground when she has stranded.
  Such efforts involve an abnormal use which is likely to cause damage to
  sails and spars, or to engines and boilers; and they are treated as acts
  of sacrifice. The case of "The Bona," 1895 (P. 125) shows that the rules
  are in accord with English law upon the point. The court of appeal held
  that both the damage sustained by the engines while worked to get the
  ship off, and the coal and stores consumed, were subjects for G.A.
  contribution at common law.</p>

<p><!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[v.03 p.0057]</span></p>

  <p>Rule VIII. allows as G.A. any damage sustained by cargo when
  discharged and, say, lightered for the purpose of getting the ship off a
  strand. And the corresponding damage in the case of cargo discharged at a
  port of refuge to enable repairs to be done to the ship is allowed by
  Rule XII. But in the latter case the allowance does not expressly extend
  to damage sustained while stored on land. Whether the law would require
  contribution to a loss of goods, say, by thieves or by fire, while landed
  for repairs, is not clear. Where the landing has been necessitated by a
  G.A. act, as cutting away masts, it would seem that the loss ought to be
  made good, as being a result of the special risks to which those goods
  have thereby been exposed. The risks which they would have run if they
  had remained on board throughout are taken into account, as will
  presently appear, in estimating <i>how much</i> of the damage is to be
  made good.</p>

  <p>Where cattle were taken into a port of refuge in Brazil, owing to
  accidental damage to the ship, with the result that they could not
  legally be landed at their destination (Deptford), and had to be taken to
  another port (Antwerp), at which they were of much less value, this loss
  of value was allowed in G.A. (<i>Anglo-Argentine &amp;c. Agency</i> v.
  <i>Temperley Shipping Co.</i>, 1899, 2 Q.B. 403).</p>

  <p>The case of a stranded ship and cargo often gives rise to difficulty
  as to whether the cost of operations to lighten the ship, and afterwards
  to get her floated, should be treated as G.A. expenditure, or as expenses
  separately incurred in saving the separate interests. The true conclusion
  seems to be that either the whole operation should be treated as one for
  the common safety, and the whole expense be contributed to by all the
  interests saved, or else the several parts of the operation should be
  kept distinct, debiting the cost of each to the interests thereby saved.
  Which of these two views should be adopted in any case seems to depend
  upon the motives with which the earlier operations (usually the discharge
  of the cargo) were presumably undertaken. It may, however, happen that
  this test cannot be applied once for all. Take the case of a stranded
  ship carrying a bulky cargo of hemp and grain, but carrying also some
  bullion. Suppose this last to be rescued and taken to a place of safety
  at small expense in comparison with its value. It may well be that that
  operation must be regarded as done in the interest simply of the bullion
  itself, but that the subsequent operations of lightening the ship and
  floating her can only be properly regarded as undertaken in the common
  interest of ship, hemp, grain and freight. In such a case there will be a
  G.A. contribution towards those later operations by those interests. But
  the bullion will not contribute; it will merely bear the expense of its
  own rescue (<i>Royal Mail S.&nbsp;P. Co.</i> v. <i>English Bank of Rio de
  Janeiro</i>, 1887, 19 Q.B.D. 362).</p>

  <p>The York-Antwerp Rules have not only had the valuable result of
  introducing uniformity where there had been great variety, and
  corresponding certainty as to the principles which will be acted upon in
  adjusting any G.A. loss, but also they have introduced greater clearness
  and definiteness on points where there had been a want of definition.
  Thus Rule XIII. has laid down a careful and definite scale to regulate
  the deductions from the cost of repairs, in respect of "new for old," in
  place of the former somewhat uncertain customary rules which varied
  according to the place of adjustment; while at the same time the
  opportunity has been taken of adapting the scale of deductions to modern
  conditions of shipbuilding. And Rule XVII. lays down a rule as to
  contributory values in place of the widely varying rules of different
  countries as to the amounts upon which ship and freight shall contribute
  (cf. Gow, <i>Marine Insurance</i>, 305).</p>

  <p>It may be of interest to refer briefly to one or two main principles
  which govern the <i>adjustment</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) of general average,
  <i>i.e.</i> the calculation of the amounts to be made good and paid by
  the several interests, which is a complicated matter. The fundamental
  idea is that the several interests at risk shall contribute in proportion
  to the benefits they have severally received by the completion of the
  adventure. Contributions are not made in proportion to the amounts at
  stake when the sacrifice was made, but in proportion to the results when
  the adventure has come to an end. An interest which has become lost after
  the sacrifice, during the subsequent course of the voyage, will pay
  nothing; an interest which has become depreciated will pay in proportion
  to the diminished value. The liability to contribute is inchoate only
  when the sacrifice has been made. It becomes complete when the adventure
  has come to an end, either by arrival at the destination, or by having
  been broken up at some intermediate point, while the interest in question
  still survives. To this there is one exception, in the case of G.A.
  <i>expenditure</i>. Where such expenditure has been incurred by the owner
  of one interest, generally by the shipowner, the repayment to him by the
  other interests ought not to be wholly dependent upon the subsequent
  safety of those interests at the ultimate destination. If those other
  interests or some of them arrive, or are realized, as by being landed at
  an intermediate port, the rule (as in the case of G.A. sacrifices) is
  that the contributions are to be in proportion to the arrived or realized
  values. But if all are lost the burden of the expenditure ought not to
  remain upon the interest which at first bore it; and the proper rule
  seems to be that contributions must be made by all the interests which
  were at stake when it was made, in proportion to their <i>then</i>
  values.</p>

  <p>Again, the object of the law of G.A. is to put one whose property is
  sacrificed upon an equal footing with the rest, not upon a better
  footing. Thus, if goods to the value of £100 have been thrown overboard
  for the general safety, the owner of those goods must not receive the
  full £100 in contribution. He himself must bear a part of it, for those
  goods formed part of the adventure for whose safety the jettison was
  made; and it is owing to the partial safety of the adventure that any
  contribution at all is received by him. He, therefore, is made to
  contribute with the other saved interests towards his own loss, in
  respect of the amount "made good" to him for that. The full £100 is
  treated as the amount to be made good, but the owner of the goods is made
  to contribute towards that upon the sum of £100 thus saved to him.</p>

  <p>The same principle has a further consequence. The amount to be made
  good will not necessarily be the value of the goods or other property in
  their condition at the time they were sacrificed; so to calculate it
  would in effect be to withdraw those goods from the subsequent risks of
  the voyage, and thus to put them in a better position than those which
  were not sacrificed. Hence, in estimating the amount to be made good, the
  value of the goods or property sacrificed must be estimated <i>as on
  arrival</i>, with reference to the condition in which they would probably
  have arrived had they remained on board throughout the voyage.</p>

  <p>The liability to pay G.A. contributions falls primarily upon the owner
  of the contributing interest, ship, goods or freight. But in practice the
  contributions are paid by the insurers of the several interests.
  Merchants seldom have to concern themselves with the subject. And yet in
  an ordinary policy of insurance there is no express provision requiring
  the underwriter to indemnify the assured against this liability. The
  policy commonly contains clauses which recognize such an obligation,
  <i>e.g.</i> a warranty against average "unless general," or an agreement
  that G.A. shall be payable "as per foreign statement," or "according to
  York-Antwerp Rules"; but it does not directly state the obligation. It
  assumes that. The explanation seems to be that the practice of the
  underwriter to pay the contribution has been so uniform, and his
  liability has been so fully recognized, that express provisions were
  needless. But one result has been that very differing views of the ground
  of the obligation have been held. One view has been that it is covered by
  the sue and labour clause of an ordinary policy, by which the insurer
  agrees to bear his proportion of expenses voluntarily incurred "in and
  about the defence, safeguard and recovery" of the insured subject. But
  that has been held to be mistaken by the House of Lords (<i>Aitchison</i>
  v. <i>Lohre</i>, 1879, 4 A.C. 755). Another view is that the underwriter
  impliedly undertakes to repay sums which the law may require the assured
  to pay towards averting losses which would, by the contract, fall upon
  the underwriter. Expenses voluntarily incurred by the assured with that
  object are expressly made repayable by the sue and labour clause of the
  policy. It might well be implied that payments compulsorily required from
  the assured by law for contributions to G.A., or as salvage for services
  by salvors, will be undertaken or repaid by the underwriter, the service
  being for his benefit. But the decision in <i>Aitchison</i> v.
  <i>Lohre</i> negatives this ground also. The claim was against
  underwriters on a ship which had been so damaged that the cost of repairs
  had exceeded her insured value. A claim for the ship's contribution to
  certain salvage and G.A. expenses which had been incurred, over and above
  the cost of repairs, was disallowed. The view seems to have been that the
  insurer is liable for salvage and G.A. payments as losses of the subject
  insured, and therefore included in the sum insured, not as collateral
  payments made on his behalf. This bases the claim against the insurer
  upon a fiction, for there has been no loss of <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[v.03 p.0058]</span>the subject
  insured; in fact, the payment has been for averting such a loss. And it
  suggests that the insurer is not liable for salvage where the policy is
  free of particular average, which does not accord with practice.</p>

  <p>An important question as to an insurer's liability for G.A. arose in
  the case of the <i>Brigella</i> (1893, P. 189), where a shipowner had
  incurred expenses which would have been the subject of G.A.
  contributions, but that he alone was interested in the voyage. There were
  no contributories. He claimed from the insurers of the ship what would
  have been the ship's G.A. contribution had there been other persons to
  contribute in respect of freight or cargo. The claim was disallowed on
  the ground that there could be no G.A. in such circumstances, and
  therefore no basis for a claim against the insurer. The liability of the
  insurer was thus made to depend, not upon the character of the loss, but
  upon the fact or possibility of contribution. But this was not followed
  in <i>Montgomery</i> v. <i>Indemnity Mutual M.&nbsp;I. Co.</i> (1901, 1 K.B.
  147). There ship, freight and cargo all belonged to the same person. He
  had insured the cargo but not the ship. The cargo underwriters were held
  liable to pay a contribution to damage done to the ship by cutting away
  masts for the general safety. The loss was in theory spread over all the
  interests at risk, and they had undertaken to bear the cargo's share of
  such losses. Their liability did not depend upon the accident of whether
  the interests all belonged to one person or not. This agrees with the
  view taken in the United States.</p>

  <p><b>AVERNUS,</b> a lake of Campania, Italy, about 1½ m. N. of Baiae. It
  is an old volcanic crater, nearly 2 m. in circumference, now, as in Roman
  times, filled with water. Its depth is 213 ft., and its height above
  sea-level 3½ ft.; it has no natural outlet. In ancient times it was
  surrounded by dense forests, and was the centre of many legends. It was
  represented as the entrance by which both Odysseus and Aeneas descended
  to the infernal regions, and as the abode of the Cimmerii. Its Greek

  tunnel over ½ m. in length, now called Grotta della Pace, through the

  including a great octagonal hall known as the Temple of Apollo, built of
  brickwork, and belonging to the 1st century. The so-called Grotto of the
  Cumaean Sibyl, on the south side, is a rock-cut passage, ventilated by
  vertical apertures, possibly a part of the works connected with the naval
  harbour. To the south-east of the lake is the Monte Nuovo, a volcanic

  <p><b>AVERROES</b> <span class="special" title="Abul-Walid Muhammad ibn-Ahmad Ibn-Muhammad ibn-Rushd"
  >[Ab&#x16B;l-Wal&#x12B;d Mu&#x1E25;ammad ibn-A&#x1E25;mad
  Ibn-Mu&#x1E25;ammad ibn-Rushd</span>] (1126-1198), Arabian philosopher,
  was born at Cordova. His early life was occupied in mastering the
  curriculum of theology, jurisprudence, mathematics, medicine and
  philosophy, under the approved teachers of the time. The years of his
  prime fell during the last period of Mahommedan rule in Spain under the
  Almohades (<i>q.v.</i>). It was Ibn-Tufail (Abubacer), the philosophic
  vizier of Yusef, who introduced Averroes to that prince, and Avenzoar
  (Ibn-Zuhr), the greatest of Moslem physicians, was his friend. Averroes,
  who was versed in the Malekite system of law, was made cadi of Seville
  (1169), and in similar appointments the next twenty-five years of his
  life were passed. We find him at different periods in Seville, Cordova
  and Morocco, probably as physician to Yusef al-Mansur, who took pleasure
  in engaging him in discussions on the theories of philosophy and their
  bearings on the faith of Islam. But science and free thought then, as
  now, in Islam, depended almost solely on the tastes of the wealthy and
  the favour of the monarch. The ignorant fanaticism of the multitude
  viewed speculative studies with deep dislike and distrust, and deemed any
  one a Zendik (infidel) who did not rest content with the natural science
  of the Koran. These smouldering hatreds burst into open flame about the
  year 1195. Averroes was accused of heretical opinions and pursuits,
  stripped of his honours, and banished to a place near Cordova, where his
  actions were closely watched. At the same time efforts were made to stamp
  out all liberal culture in Andalusia, so far as it went beyond the little
  medicine, arithmetic and astronomy required for practical life. But the
  storm soon passed. Averroes was recalled to Morocco when the transient
  passion of the people had been satisfied, and for a brief period survived
  his restoration to honour. He died in the year before his patron,
  al-Mansur, with whom (in 1199) the political power of the Moslems came to
  an end, as did the culture of liberal science with Averroes. The
  philosopher left several sons, some of whom became jurists like his own
  grandfather. One of them has left an essay, expounding his father's
  theory of the intellect. The personal character of Averroes is known to
  us only in a general way, and as we can gather it from his writings. His
  clear, exhaustive and dignified style of treatment evidences the
  rectitude and nobility of the man. In the histories of his own nation he
  has little place; the renown which spread in his lifetime to the East
  ceased with his death, and he left no school. Yet, from a note in a
  manuscript, we know that he had intelligent readers in Spain more than a
  century afterwards. His historic fame came from the Christian Schoolmen,
  whom he almost initiated into the system of Aristotle, and who, but
  vaguely discerning the expositors who preceded, admired in his
  commentaries the accumulated results of two centuries of labours.</p>

  <p>The literary works of Averroes include treatises on jurisprudence,
  grammar, astronomy, medicine and philosophy. In 1859 a work of Averroes
  was for the first time published in Arabic by the Bavarian Academy, and a
  German translation appeared in 1873 by the editor, J. Müller. It is a
  treatise entitled <i>Philosophy and Theology</i>, and, with the exception
  of a German version of the essay on the conjunction of the intellect with
  man, is the first translation which enables the non-Semitic scholar to
  form any adequate idea of Averroes. The Latin translations of most of his
  works are barbarous and obscure. A great part of his writings,
  particularly on jurisprudence and astronomy, as well as essays on special
  logical subjects, prolegomena to philosophy, criticisms on Avicenna and
  Alfarabius (F&#x101;r&#x101;b&#x12B;), remain in manuscript in the
  Escorial and other libraries. The Latin editions of his medical works
  include the <i>Colliget</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>Kulliyyat</i>, or summary), a
  <i>résumé</i> of medical science, and a commentary on Avicenna's poem on
  medicine; but Averroes, in medical renown, always stood far below
  Avicenna. The Latin editions of his philosophical works comprise the
  <i>Commentaries on Aristotle</i>, the <i>Destructio Destructionis</i>
  (against Ghaz&#x101;li), the <i>De Substantia Orbis</i> and a double
  treatise <i>De Animae Beatitudine</i>. The Commentaries of Averroes fall
  under three heads:&mdash;the larger commentaries, in which a paragraph is
  quoted at large, and its clauses expounded one by one; the medium
  commentaries, which cite only the first words of a section; and the
  paraphrases or analyses, treatises on the subjects of the Aristotelian
  books. The larger commentary was an innovation of Averroes; for Avicenna,
  copied by Albertus Magnus, gave under the rubrics furnished by Aristotle
  works in which, though the materials were borrowed, the grouping was his
  own. The great commentaries exist only for the <i>Posterior
  Analytics</i>, <i>Physics</i>, <i>De Caelo</i>, <i>De Anima</i> and
  <i>Metaphysics</i>. On the <i>History of Animals</i> no commentary at all
  exists, and Plato's <i>Republic</i> is substituted for the then

  1480 and 1580 number about 100. The first <!-- Page 59 --><span

  <p><b>AVERRUNCATOR,</b> a form of long shears used in arboriculture for
  "averruncating" or pruning off the higher branches of trees, &amp;c. The
  word "averruncate" (from Lat. <i>averruncare</i>, to ward off, remove
  mischief) glided into meaning to "weed the ground," "prune vines,"
  &amp;c., by a supposed derivation from the Lat. <i>ab</i>, off, and
  <i>eruncare</i>, to weed out, and it was spelt "aberuncate" to suit this;
  but the <i>New English Dictionary</i> regards such a derivation as
  impossible.</p>

  <p><b>AVERSA,</b> a town and episcopal see of Campania, Italy, in the
  province of Caserta, 15½ m. S.S.W. by rail from Caserta, and 12½ m. N. by
  rail from Naples, from which there is also an electric tramway. Pop.
  (1901) 23,477. Aversa was the first place in which the Normans settled,
  it being granted to them in 1027 for the help which they had given to
  Duke Sergius of Naples against Pandulf IV. of Capua. The Benedictine
  abbey of S. Lorenzo preserves a portal of the 11th century. There is also
  a large lunatic asylum, founded by Joachim Murat in 1813.</p>

  <p><b>AVESNES,</b> a town of northern France, capital of an
  arrondissement in the department of Nord, on the Helpe, 28 m. S.E. of
  Valenciennes by rail. Pop. (1906) 5076. The town is the seat of a
  sub-prefect, and has a tribunal of first instance, a chamber of commerce
  and a communal college. Its church of St Nicholas (16th century) has a
  tower 200 ft. high, with a fine chime of bells. The chief industry of the
  town is wool-spinning, and there is trade in wood. Avesnes was founded in
  the 11th century, and formed a countship which in the 15th century passed
  to the house of Burgundy and afterwards to that of Habsburg. In 1477 it
  was destroyed by Louis XI. By the treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) it came
  into the possession of the French, and was fortified by Vauban. It was
  captured by the Prussians in 1815.</p>

  <p><b>AVEYRON,</b> a department of southern France, bounded N. by Cantal,
  E. by Lozère and Card, S.W. by Tarn and W. by Tarn-et-Garonne and Lot.
  Area, 3386 sq. m. Pop. (1906) 377,299. It corresponds nearly to the old
  district of Rouergue, which gave its name to a countship established
  early in the 9th century, and united with that of Toulouse towards the
  end of the 11th century. The earliest known natives of this region were
  the Celtic Rutheni, to whom the numerous megalithic monuments found in
  the department are attributed. Aveyron lies on the southern border of the
  central plateau of France. Its chief rivers are the Lot in the north, the
  Aveyron in the centre and the Tarn in the south, all tributaries of the
  Garonne. They flow from east to west, following the general slope of the
  department, and divide it into four zones. In the north-east, between the
  Lot and its tributary the Truyère, lies the lonely pastoral plateau of
  the Viadène, dominated by the volcanic mountains of Aubrac, which form
  the north-eastern limit of the department and include its highest summit
  (4760 ft.). Entraygues, at the confluence of the Lot and the Truyère, is
  one of the many picturesque towns of the department. Between the Lot and
  the Aveyron is a belt of <i>causses</i> or monotonous limestone
  table-lands, broken here and there by profound and beautiful
  gorges&mdash;a type of scenery characteristic of Aveyron. This zone is
  also watered by the Dourdou du Nord, a tributary of the Lot. The salient
  feature of the region between the Tarn and the Aveyron is the plateau of
  the Ségala, bordered on the east by the heights of Lévezou and Palanges
  and traversed from east to west by the deep valley of the Viaur, a
  tributary of the Aveyron. The country south of the Tarn is occupied in
  great part by the huge plateau of Larzac, which lies between the Causse
  Noir and the Causse St Affrique, the three forming the south-western
  termination of the Cévennes. On the Causse Noir is found the fantastic
  chaos of rocks and precipices known as Montpellier-le-Vieux, resembling
  the ruins of a huge city. The climate of Aveyron varies from extreme
  rigour in the mountains to mildness in the sheltered valleys; the south
  wind is sometimes of great violence. Wheat, rye and oats are the chief
  cereals cultivated, the soil of Aveyron being naturally poor. Other crops
  are potatoes, colza, hemp and flax. The mainstay of the agriculture of
  the department is the raising of live-stock, especially of cattle of the
  Aubrac breed, for which Laguiole is an important market. The wines of
  Entraygues, St Georges, Bouillac and Najac have some reputation; in the
  Ségala chestnuts form an important element in the food of the peasants,
  and the walnut, cider-apple, mulberry (for the silk-worm industry), and
  plum are among the fruit trees grown. The production of Roquefort cheeses
  is prominent among the agricultural industries. They are made from the
  milk of the large flocks of the plateau of Larzac, and the choicest are
  ripened in the even temperature of the caves in the cliff which overhangs
  Roquefort. The minerals found in the department include the coal of the
  basins of Aubin and Rodez as well as iron, zinc and lead. Quarries of
  various kinds of stone are also worked. The chief industrial centres are
  Decazeville, which has metallurgical works, and Millau, where
  leather-dressing and the manufacture of gloves have attained considerable
  importance. Wool-weaving and the manufacture of woollen goods, machinery,
  chemicals and bricks are among the other industries.</p>

  <p>There are five arrondissements, of which the chief towns are Rodez,
  capital of the department, Espalion, Millau, St Affrique and
  Villefranche, with 43 cantons and 304 communes. Rodez is the seat of a
  bishopric, the diocese of which comprises the department. Aveyron belongs
  to the 16th military region, and to the <i>académie</i> or educational
  circumscription of Toulouse. Its court of appeal is at Montpellier. The
  department is traversed by the lines both of the Orléans and Southern
  railways. The more important towns are Rodez, Millau, St Affrique,
  Villefranche-de-Rouergue and Decazeville. The following are also of
  interest:&mdash;Sauveterre, founded in 1281, a striking example of the
  bastide (<i>q.v.</i>) of that period; Conques, which has a remarkable
  abbey-church of the 11th century like St Sernin of Toulouse in plan and
  possessing a rich treasury of reliquaries, &amp;c.; Espalion, where
  amongst other old buildings there are the remains of a feudal stronghold
  and a church of the Romanesque period; Najac, which has the ruins of a
  magnificent château of the 13th century; and Sylvanès, with a church of
  the 12th century, once attached to a Cistercian abbey.</p>

  <p><b>AVEZZANO,</b> a town of the Abruzzi, Italy, in the province of
  Aquila, 67 m. E. of Rome by rail and 38 m. S. of Aquila by road. Pop.
  (1901) 9442. It has a fine and well-preserved castle, built in 1490 by
  Gentile Virginio Orsini; it is square, with round towers at the angles.
  Avezzano is on the main line from Rome to Castellammare Adriatico; a
  branch railway diverges to Roccasecca, on the line from Naples to Rome.
  The Lago Fucino lies 1½ m. to the east.</p>

  <p><b>AVIANUS,</b> a Latin writer of fables, placed by some critics in
  the age of the Antonines, by others as late as the 6th century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> He appears to have lived at Rome and to have
  been a heathen. The 42 fables which bear his name are dedicated to a
  certain Theodosius, whose learning is spoken of in most flattering terms.
  He may possibly be Macrobius Theodosius, the author of the
  <i>Saturnalia</i>; some think he may be the emperor of that name. Nearly
  all the fables are to be found in Babrius, who was probably Avianus's
  source of inspiration, but as Babrius wrote in Greek, and Avianus speaks
  of having made an elegiac version from a rough Latin copy, probably a
  prose paraphrase, he was not indebted to the original. The language and
  metre are on the whole correct, in spite of deviations from classical
  usage, chiefly in the management of the pentameter. The fables soon
  became popular as a school-book. Promythia and epimythia (introductions
  and morals) and paraphrases, and imitations were frequent, such as the
  <i>Novus Avianus</i> of Alexander Neckam (12th century).</p>

  <p><b>AVIARY</b> (from Lat. <i>avis</i>, a bird), called by older writers
  "volary," a structure in which birds are kept in a state of captivity.
  While the habit of keeping birds in cages dates from a very remote
  period, it is probable that structures worthy of being termed aviaries
  were first used by the ancient Romans, chiefly for the process of
  fattening birds for the table. In Varro's time, 116-127 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, aviaries or "ornithones" (from Gr. <span
  title="ornis, ornithos" class="grk">&#x1F44;&rho;&nu;&iota;&sigmaf;,
  &#x1F44;&rho;&nu;&iota;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, bird) were
  common. These consisted of two kinds, those constructed for pleasure, in
  which were kept nightingales and other song-birds, and those used
  entirely for keeping and fattening birds for market or for the tables of
  their owners. Varro himself had an aviary for song-birds exclusively,
  while Lucullus combined the two classes, keeping birds both for pleasure
  and as delicacies for his table. The keeping of birds for pleasure,
  however, was very rarely indulged in, while it was a common practice with
  poulterers and others to have large ornithones either in the city or at
  Sabinum for the fattening of thrushes and other birds for food.</p>

  <p>Ornithones consisted merely of four high walls and a roof, and were
  lighted with a few very small windows, as the birds were considered to
  pine less if they could not see their free companions outside. Water was
  introduced by means of pipes, and conducted in narrow channels, and the
  birds were fed chiefly upon dried figs, carefully peeled, and chewed into
  a pulp by persons hired to perform this operation.</p>

  <p>Turtle-doves were fattened in large numbers for the market on wheat
  and millet, the latter being moistened with sweet wine; but thrushes were
  chiefly in request, and Varro mentions one ornithon from which no less
  than five thousand of these birds were sold for the table in one
  season.</p>

  <p>The habit of keeping birds in aviaries, as we understand the term, for
  the sake of the pleasure they afford their owners and for studying their
  habits is, however, of comparatively recent date. The beginning of
  geographical research in the 15th century brought with it the desire to
  keep and study at home some of the beautiful forms of bird-life which the
  explorers came across, and hence it became the custom to erect aviaries
  for the reception of these creatures. In the 16th century, in the early
  part of which the canary-bird was introduced into Europe, aviaries were
  not uncommon features of the gardens of the wealthy, and Bacon refers to
  them in his essay on gardening (1597). Elizabeth of Bohemia, the daughter
  of James I. of England, when a child, had an outdoor aviary at Coombe
  Abbey near Coventry, the back and roof of which were formed of natural
  rock, in which were kept birds of many species from many countries.</p>

  <p>Within recent years the method of keeping birds in large aviaries has
  received considerable attention, and it is fully recognized that by so
  doing, not only do we derive great pleasure, but our knowledge of avian
  habits and mode of living can thereby be very considerably increased.</p>

  <p>An aviary may be of almost any size, from the large cage known, on
  account of its shape, as the "Crystal Palace aviary," to a structure as
  large as a church; and the term is sometimes applied to the room of a
  house with the windows covered with wire-netting; but as a rule it is
  used for outdoor structures, composed principally of wire-netting
  supported on a framework of either iron or woodwork. For quite hardy
  birds little more than this is necessary, providing that protection is
  given in the form of growing trees and shrubs, rock-work or rough wooden
  shelters. For many of the delicate species, however, which hail from
  tropical countries, warmth must be provided during the inclement months
  of the year, and thus a part at least of an aviary designed for these
  birds must be in the form of a wooden or brick house which can be shut up
  in cold weather and artificially warmed.</p>

  <p>The ideal aviary, probably, is that which is constructed in two parts,
  viz. a well-built house for the winter, opening out into a large wire
  enclosure for use in the summer months. The doors between the two
  portions may be of wood or glazed. The part intended as the winter home
  of the birds is best built in brick or stone, as these materials are
  practically vermin-proof and the temperature in such a building is less
  variable than that in a thin wooden structure. The floor should be of
  concrete or brick, and the house should be fitted with an efficient
  heating apparatus from which the heat is distributed by means of
  hot-water pipes. Any arrangement which would permit the escape into the
  aviary of smoke or noxious fumes is to be strongly condemned. Such a
  house must be well lighted, preferably by means of skylights; but it is a
  mistake to have the whole roof glazed, at least half of it should be of
  wood, covered with slates or tiles. Perches consisting of branches of
  trees with the bark adhering should be fixed up, and, if small birds are
  to be kept, bundles of bushy twigs should be securely fixed up in corners
  under the roofs.</p>

  <p>The outer part, which will principally be used during the summer,
  though it will do most birds good to be let out for a few hours on mild
  winter days also, should be as large as possible, and constructed
  entirely of wire-netting stretched on a framework of wood or iron. If the
  latter material is selected, stout gas-piping is both stronger and more
  easily fitted together than solid iron rods.</p>

  <p>If the framework be of wood, this should be creosoted, preferably
  under pressure, or painted with three coats of good lead paint, the
  latter preservative also being used if iron is the material selected.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="Fig. 1." title="Fig. 1." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.
  </div>

  <p>The wire-netting used may be of almost any sized mesh, according to
  the sized birds to be kept, but as a general rule the smallest mesh, such
  as half or five-eighths of an inch, should be used, as it is practically
  vermin-proof, and allows of birds of any size being kept. Wire-netting
  for aviaries should be of the best quality, and well galvanized. The new
  interlinked type is less durable than the old mesh type, though perhaps
  it looks somewhat neater when fixed.</p>

  <p>Provision must be made for the entire exclusion of such vermin as
  rats, stoats and weasels, which, if they were to gain access, would
  commit great havoc amongst the birds. The simplest and most effectual
  method of doing this is by sinking the wire-netting some 2 ft. into the
  ground all round the aviary, and then turning it outwards for a distance
  of another foot as shown in the annexed cut (fig. 1).</p>

  <p>The outer part of the aviary should be turfed and planted with
  evergreen and deciduous shrubs, and be provided with some means of
  supplying an abundance of pure water for the birds to drink and bathe in;
  a gravel path should not be forgotten.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most useful type of aviary is that built as above
  described, but with several compartments, and a passage at the back by
  which any compartment may be visited without the necessity of passing
  through and disturbing the birds in other compartments. Fig. 2 represents
  a ground plan of an aviary of this type divided into four compartments,
  each with an inner house 10 ft. square, and an outer flight of double
  that area. The outer flights are intended to be turfed, and planted with
  shrubs, and the gravel path has a glazed roof above it by which it is
  kept dry in wet weather. Shallow water-basins are shown, which should be
  supplied by means of an underground pipe and a cock which can be turned
  on from outside the aviary; and they must be connected with a properly
  laid drain by means of a waste plug and an overflow pipe.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Plan of 4-compartment Aviary for
    Foreign Birds.
  </div>

  <p>An aviary should always be built with a southern or southeastern
  aspect, and, where possible, should be sheltered from the north,
  north-east and north-west by a belt of fir-trees, high wall or bank, to
  protect the birds from the biting winds from these quarters.</p>

  <p>When parrots of any kind are to be kept it is useless to try <!-- Page
  61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[v.03 p.0061]</span>to
  grow any kind of vegetation except grass, and even this will be
  demolished unless the aviary is of considerable size. The larger parrots
  will, in fact, bite to pieces not only living trees but also the woodwork
  of their abode, and the only really suitable materials for the
  construction of an aviary for these birds are brick or stone and iron;
  and the wire-netting used must be of the stoutest gauge or it will be
  torn to pieces by their strong bills.</p>

  <p>The feeding of birds in aviaries is, obviously, a matter of the utmost
  importance, and, in order that they may have what is most suitable, the
  aviculturist should find out as much as possible of the wild life of the
  species he wishes to keep, or if little or nothing is known about their
  mode of living, as is often the case with rare forms, of nearly related
  species whose habits and food are probably much the same, and he should
  endeavour to provide food as nearly as possible resembling that which
  would be obtained by the birds when wild. It is often, however,
  impossible to supply precisely the same food as would be obtained by the
  birds had they their liberty, but a substitute which suits them well can
  generally be obtained. The majority of the parrot tribe subsist
  principally upon various nuts, seed and fruit, while some of the smaller
  parrakeets or paroquets appear to feed almost exclusively upon the seeds
  of various grasses. Almost all of these are comparatively easy to treat
  in captivity, the larger ones being fed on maize, sunflower-seed, hemp,
  dari, oats, canary-seed, nuts and various ripe fruits, while the
  grass-parrakeets thrive remarkably well on little besides canary-seed and
  green food, the most suitable of which is grass in flower, chickweed,
  groundsel and various seed-bearing weeds. But there is another large
  group of parrots, the <i>Loriidae</i> or brush-tongued parrots, some of
  the most interesting and brightly coloured of the tribe, which, when
  wild, subsist principally upon the pollen and nectar of flowers, notably
  the various species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, the filamented tongues of these
  parrots being peculiarly adapted for obtaining this. In captivity these
  birds have been found to live well upon sweetened milk-sop, which is made
  by pouring boiling milk upon crumbled bread or biscuit. They frequently
  learn to eat seed like other parrots, but, if fed exclusively upon this,
  are apt, especially if deprived of abundance of exercise, to suffer from
  fits which are usually fatal. Fruit is also readily eaten by the lories
  and lorikeets, and should always be supplied.</p>

  <p>The foreign doves and pigeons form a numerous and beautiful group
  which are mostly hardy and easily kept and bred in captivity. They are
  for the most part grain-feeders and require only small corn and seeds,
  though a certain group, known as the fruit-pigeons, are fed in captivity
  upon soft fruits, berries, boiled potato and soaked grain.</p>

  <p>The various finches and finch-like birds form an exceedingly large
  group and comprise perhaps the most popular of foreign aviary birds. The
  weaver-birds of Africa are mostly quite hardy and very easily kept, their
  food consisting, for the most part, of canary-seed. The males of these
  birds are, as a rule, gorgeously attired in brilliant colours, some
  having long flowing tail-feathers during the nuptial season, while in the
  winter their showy dress is replaced by one of sparrow-like sombreness.
  The grass-finches of Australasia contain some of the most brilliantly
  coloured birds, the beautiful grass-finch (<i>Poëphila mirabilis</i>)
  being resplendent in crimson, green, mauve, blue and yellow. Most of
  these birds build their nests, and many rear their young, successfully in
  outdoor aviaries, their food consisting of canary and millet seeds, while
  flowering grasses provide them with an endless source of pleasure and
  wholesome food. The same treatment suits the African waxbills, many of
  which are extremely beautiful, the crimson-eared waxbill or "cordon-bleu"
  being one of the most lovely and frequently imported. These little birds
  are somewhat delicate, especially when first imported, and during the
  winter months require artificial warmth.</p>

  <p>There is a very large group of insectivorous and fruit-eating birds
  very suitable for aviculture, but their mode of living necessarily
  involves considerable care on the part of the aviculturist in the
  preparation of their food. Many birds are partially insectivorous,
  feeding upon insects when these are plentiful, and upon various seeds at
  other times. Numbers of species again which, when adult, feed almost
  entirely upon grain, feed their young, especially during the early stages
  of their existence, upon insects; while others are exclusively
  insect-eaters at all times of their lives. All of these points must be
  considered by those who would succeed in keeping and breeding birds in
  aviaries.</p>

  <p>It would be almost an impossibility to keep the purely insectivorous
  species, were it not for the fact that they can be gradually accustomed
  to feed on what is known as "insectivorous" or "insectile" food, a
  composition of which the principal ingredients generally consist of dried
  ants' cocoons, dried flies, dried powdered meat, preserved yolk of egg,<a
  name="FnAnchor_041" href="#Footnote_041"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and crumb of
  bread or biscuit. This is moistened with water or mixed with mashed
  boiled potato, and forms a diet upon which most of the insectivorous
  birds thrive. The various ingredients, or the food ready made, can be
  obtained at almost any bird-fancier's shop. Although it is a good staple
  diet for these birds, the addition of mealworms, caterpillars, grubs,
  spiders and so forth is often a necessity, especially for purely
  insectivorous species.</p>

  <p>The fruit-eating species, such as the tanagers and sugar-birds of the
  New World, require ripe fruit in abundance in addition to a staple diet
  such as that above described, while for such birds as feed largely upon
  earth-worms, shredded raw meat is added with advantage.</p>

  <p>Many of the waders make very interesting aviary birds, and require a
  diet similar to that above recommended, with the addition of chopped raw
  meat, mealworms and any insects that can be obtained.</p>

  <p>Birds of prey naturally require a meat diet, which is best given in
  the form of small, freshly killed mammals and birds, the fur or feathers
  of which should not be removed, as they aid digestion.</p>

  <p>The majority of wild birds, from whatever part of the world they may
  come, will breed successfully in suitable aviaries providing proper
  nesting sites are available. Large bundles of brushwood, fixed up in
  sheltered spots, will afford accommodation for many kinds of birds, while
  some will readily build in evergreen shrubs if these are grown in their
  enclosure. Small boxes and baskets, securely fastened to the wall or roof
  of the <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>[v.03
  p.0062]</span>sheltered part of an aviary, will be appropriated by such
  species as naturally build in holes and crevices. Parrots, when wild, lay
  their eggs in hollow trees, and occasionally in holes in rocks, making no
  nest,<a name="FnAnchor_042" href="#Footnote_042"><sup>[2]</sup></a> but
  merely scraping out a slight hollow in which to deposit the eggs. For
  these birds hollow logs, with small entrance holes near the top, or
  boxes, varying in size according to the size of the parrots which they
  are intended for, should be supplied. In providing nesting accommodation
  for his birds the aviculturist must endeavour to imitate their natural
  surroundings and supply sites as nearly as possible similar to those
  which the birds, to whatever order they may belong, would naturally
  select.</p>

  <p>Aviculture is a delightful pastime, but it is also far more than this;
  it is of considerable scientific importance, for it admits of the living
  birds being studied in a way that would be quite impossible otherwise.
  There are hundreds of species of birds, from all parts of the world, the
  habits of which are almost unknown, but which may be kept without
  difficulty in suitable aviaries. Many of these birds cannot be studied
  satisfactorily in a wild state by reason of their shy nature and retiring
  habits, not to mention their rarity and the impossibility, so far as most
  people are concerned, of visiting their native haunts. In suitable large
  aviaries, however, their nesting habits, courtship, display, incubation,
  moult and so forth can be accurately observed and recorded. The keeping
  of birds in aviaries is therefore a practice worthy of every
  encouragement, so long as the aviaries are of sufficient size and
  suitable design to allow of the birds exhibiting their natural habits;
  for in a large aviary they will reveal the secrets of their nature as
  they never would do in a cage or small aviary.</p>

  <p>(D. S.-S.)</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Footnote_041" href="#FnAnchor_041">[1]</a> It has recently
  been stated by certain medical men that egg-food in any form is an
  undesirable diet for birds, owing to its being peculiarly adapted to the
  multiplication of the bacillus of septicaemia, a disease which is
  responsible for the death of many newly imported birds. It is a
  significant fact, however, that insectivorous species, which are those
  principally fed upon this substance, are not nearly so susceptible to
  this disease as seed-eating birds which rarely taste egg; and in spite of
  what has been written concerning its harmfulness, the large majority of
  aviculturists use it, in both the fresh and the preserved state, with no
  apparent ill effects, but rather the reverse.</p>

  The true love-birds (<i>Agapornis</i>) may also be said to build nests,

  <p><b>AVICENNA</b> [Ab&#x16B; &#x201B;Al&#x12B; al-Husain ibn
  &#x201B;Abdall&#x101;h ibn S&#x12B;n&#x101;] (980-1037), Arabian
  philosopher, was born at Afshena in the district of Bokhara. His mother
  was a native of the place; his father, a Persian from Balkh, filled the
  post of tax-collector in the neighbouring town of Harmaitin, under
  N&#x16B;h II. ibn Mansur, the Samanid amir of Bokhara. On the birth of
  Avicenna's younger brother the family migrated to Bokhara, then one of
  the chief cities of the Moslem world, and famous for a culture which was
  older than its conquest by the Saracens. Avicenna was put in charge of a
  tutor, and his precocity soon made him the marvel of his
  neighbours,&mdash;as a boy of ten who knew by rote the Koran and much
  Arabic poetry besides. From a greengrocer he learnt arithmetic; and
  higher branches were begun under one of those wandering scholars who
  gained a livelihood by cures for the sick and lessons for the young.
  Under him Avicenna read the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyry and the first
  propositions of Euclid. But the pupil soon found his teacher to be but a
  charlatan, and betook himself, aided by commentaries, to master logic,
  geometry and the Almagest. Before he was sixteen he not merely knew
  medical theory, but by gratuitous attendance on the sick had, according
  to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment. For the next
  year and a half he worked at the higher philosophy, in which he
  encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry he
  would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then hie to the
  mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep
  into the night he would continue his studies, stimulating his senses by
  occasional cups of wine, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him
  and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the
  <i>Metaphysics</i> of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his
  memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they
  found illumination from the little commentary by F&#x101;r&#x101;b&#x12B;
  (<i>q.v.</i>), which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three
  dirhems. So great was his joy at the discovery, thus made by help of a
  work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return
  thanks to God, and bestowed an alms upon the poor. Thus, by the end of
  his seventeenth year his apprenticeship of study was concluded, and he
  went forth to find a market for his accomplishments.</p>

  <p>His first appointment was that of physician to the amir, who owed him
  his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Avicenna's chief reward for
  this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids
  (<i>q.v.</i>), well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the
  library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Avicenna
  accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of
  his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial
  labours, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.</p>

  <p>At the age of twenty-two Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty
  came to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the
  offers of Mahm&#x16B;d the Ghaznevid, and proceeded westwards to Urjensh
  in the modern Khiva, where the vizier, regarded as a friend of scholars,
  gave him a small monthly stipend. But the pay was small, and Avicenna
  wandered from place to place through the districts of Nishapur and Merv
  to the borders of Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. Shams
  al-Ma&#x201B;&#x101;l&#x12B; Q&#x101;b&#x16B;s, the generous ruler of
  Dailam, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom he had expected to find
  an asylum, was about that date (1012) starved to death by his own
  revolted soldiery. Avicenna himself was at this season stricken down by a
  severe illness. Finally, at Jorj&#x101;n, near the Caspian, he met with a
  friend, who bought near his own house a dwelling in which Avicenna
  lectured on logic and astronomy. For this patron several of his treatises
  were written; and the commencement of his <i>Canon of Medicine</i> also
  dates from his stay in Hyrcania.</p>

  <p>He subsequently settled at Rai, in the vicinity of the modern Teheran,
  where a son of the last amir, Majd Addaula, was nominal ruler, under the
  regency of his mother. At Rai about thirty of his shorter works are said
  to have been composed. But the constant feuds which raged between the
  regent and her second son, Shams Addaula, compelled the scholar to quit
  the place, and after a brief sojourn at Kazw&#x12B;n, he passed
  southwards to Hamad&#x101;n, where that prince had established himself.
  At first he entered into the service of a high-born lady; but ere long
  the amir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and
  sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Avicenna was even raised to
  the office of vizier; but the turbulent soldiery, composed of Kurds and
  Turks, mutinied against their nominal sovereign, and demanded that the
  new vizier should be put to death. Shams Addaula consented that he should
  be banished from the country. Avicenna, however, remained hidden for
  forty days in a sheik's house, till a fresh attack of illness induced the
  amir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time he
  prosecuted his studies and teaching. Every evening extracts from his
  great works, the <i>Canon</i> and the <i>Sanatio</i>, were dictated and
  explained to his pupils; among whom, when the lesson was over, he spent
  the rest of the night in festive enjoyment with a band of singers and
  players. On the death of the amir Avicenna ceased to be vizier, and hid
  himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he
  continued the composition of his works. Meanwhile, he had written to Abu
  Ya&#x201B;far, the prefect of Isfahan, offering his services; but the new
  amir of Hamad&#x101;n getting to hear of this correspondence, and
  discovering the place of Avicenna's concealment, incarcerated him in a
  fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and
  Hamad&#x101;n; in 1024 the former captured Hamad&#x101;n and its towns,
  and expelled the Turkish mercenaries. When the storm had passed Avicenna
  returned with the amir to Hamad&#x101;n, and carried on his literary
  labours; but at length, accompanied by his brother, a favourite pupil,
  and two slaves, made his escape out of the city in the dress of a Sufite
  ascetic. After a perilous journey they reached Isfahan, and received an
  honourable welcome from the prince. The remaining ten or twelve years of
  Avicenna's life were spent in the service of Abu Ya&#x201B;far
  &#x201B;Al&#x101; Addaula, whom he accompanied as physician and general
  literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns. During
  these years he began to study literary matters and philology, instigated,
  it is asserted, by <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>[v.03 p.0063]</span>criticisms on his style. But amid
  his restless study Avicenna never forgot his love of enjoyment. Unusual
  bodily vigour enabled him to combine severe devotion to work with facile
  indulgence in sensual pleasures. His passion for wine and women was
  almost as well known as his learning. Versatile, light-hearted, boastful
  and pleasure-loving, he contrasts with the nobler and more intellectual
  character of Averroes. His bouts of pleasure gradually weakened his
  constitution; a severe colic, which seized him on the march of the army
  against Hamad&#x101;n, was checked by remedies so violent that Avicenna
  could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with
  difficulty he reached Hamad&#x101;n, where, finding the disease gaining
  ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself
  to his fate. On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on
  the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and every third day
  till his death listened to the reading of the Koran. He died in June
  1037, in his fifty-eighth year, and was buried in Hamad&#x101;n.</p>

  <p>It was mainly accident which determined that from the 12th to the 17th
  century Avicenna should be the guide of medical study in European
  universities, and eclipse the names of Rhazes, Ali ibn al-Abbas and
  Avenzoar. His work is not essentially different from that of his
  predecessors Rhazes and Ali; all present the doctrine of Galen, and
  through Galen the doctrine of Hippocrates, modified by the system of
  Aristotle. But the <i>Canon</i> of Avicenna is distinguished from the
  <i>Al-Hawi</i> (<i>Continens</i>) or <i>Summary</i> of Rhazes by its
  greater method, due perhaps to the logical studies of the former, and
  entitling him to his surname of Prince of the Physicians. The work has
  been variously appreciated in subsequent ages, some regarding it as a
  treasury of wisdom, and others, like Avenzoar, holding it useful only as
  waste paper. In modern times it has been more criticized than read. The
  vice of the book is excessive classification of bodily faculties, and
  over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases. It includes five books;
  of which the first and second treat of physiology, pathology and hygiene,
  the third and fourth deal with the methods of treating disease, and the
  fifth describes the composition and preparation of remedies. This last
  part contains some contingent of personal observation. He is, like all
  his countrymen, ample in the enumeration of symptoms, and is said to be
  inferior to Ali in practical medicine and surgery. He introduced into
  medical theory the four causes of the Peripatetic system. Of natural
  history and botany he pretends to no special knowledge. Up to the year
  1650, or thereabouts, the <i>Canon</i> was still used as a text-book in
  the universities of Louvain and Montpellier.</p>

  <p>About 100 treatises are ascribed to Avicenna. Some of them are tracts
  of a few pages, others are works extending through several volumes. The
  best-known amongst them, and that to which Avicenna owed his European
  reputation, is the <i>Canon of Medicine</i>; an Arabic edition of it
  appeared at Rome in 1593, and a Hebrew version at Naples in 1491. Of the
  Latin version there were about thirty editions, founded on the original
  translation by Gerard of Cremona. The 15th century has the honour of
  composing the great commentary on the text of the <i>Canon</i>, grouping
  around it all that theory had imagined, and all that practice had
  observed. Other medical works translated into Latin are the
  <i>Medicamenta Cordialia</i>, <i>Canticum de Medicina</i>, <i>Tractatus
  de Syrupo Acetoso</i>. Scarcely any member of the Arabian circle of the
  sciences, including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics
  and music, was left untouched by the treatises of Avicenna, many of which
  probably varied little, except in being commissioned by a different
  patron and having a different form or extent. He wrote at least one
  treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to
  him. His book on animals was translated by Michael Scot. His
  <i>Logic</i>, <i>Metaphysics</i>, <i>Physics</i>, <i>De Caelo</i>, are
  treatises giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine. The
  <i>Logic</i> and <i>Metaphysics</i> have been printed more than once, the
  latter, <i>e.g.</i>, at Venice in 1493, 1495 and 1546. Some of his
  shorter essays on medicine, logic, &amp;c., take a poetical form (the
  poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836). Two encyclopaedic
  treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger,
  <i>Al-Shif&#x101;&rsquo;</i> (<i>Sanatio</i>), exists nearly complete in
  manuscript in the Bodleian library and elsewhere; part of it on the <i>De
  Anima</i> appeared at Pavia (1490) as the <i>Liber Sextus Naturalium</i>,
  and the long account of Avicenna's philosophy given by Shahrastani seems
  to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the
  <i>Al-Shif&#x101;'</i>, A shorter form of the work is known as the
  <i>An-naj&#x101;t</i> (<i>Liberatio</i>). The Latin editions of part of
  these works have been modified by the corrections which the monkish
  editors confess that they applied. There is also a <i>Philosophia
  Orientalis</i>, mentioned by Roger Bacon, and now lost, which according
  to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.</p>

  <p><b>AVIENUS, RUFIUS FESTUS,</b> a Roman aristocrat and poet, of
  Vulsinii in Etruria, who flourished during the second half of the 4th
  century <span class="scac">A.D.</span> He was probably proconsul of
  Africa (366) and of Achaia (372). Avienus was a pagan and a staunch
  supporter of the old religion. He translated the <span title="Phainomena" class="grk"
  >&Phi;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&#x1F79;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;</span> of Aratus
  and paraphrased the <span title="Periêgêsis" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&#x1F75;&gamma;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>
  of Dionysius under the title of <i>Descriptio Orbis Terrarum</i>, both in
  hexameters. He also compiled a description, in iambic trimeters, of the
  coasts of the Mediterranean, Caspian and Black Seas in several books, of
  which only a fragment of the first is extant. He also epitomized Livy and
  Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> in the same metre, but these works are lost. Some
  minor poems are found under his name in anthologies, <i>e.g.</i> a
  humorous request to one Favianus for some pomegranates for medicinal
  purposes.</p>

  <p><b>AVIGLIANA,</b> a town of Piedmont, Italy, in the province of Turin,
  14 m. W. by rail from the town of Turin. Pop. (1901) 4629. It has
  medieval buildings of some interest, but is mainly remarkable for its
  large dynamite factory, employing over 500 workman.</p>

  <p><b>AVIGNON,</b> a city of south-eastern France, capital of the
  department of Vaucluse, 143 m. S. of Lyons on the railway between that
  city and Marseilles. Pop. (1906) 35,356. Avignon, which lies on the left
  bank of the Rhone, a few miles above its confluence with the Durance,
  occupies a large oval-shaped area not fully populated, and covered in
  great part by parks and gardens. A suspension bridge leads over the river
  to Villeneuve-lès-Avignon (<i>q.v.</i>), and a little higher up, a
  picturesque ruined bridge of the 12th century, the Pont Saint-Bénézet,
  projects into the stream. Only four of the eighteen piles are left; on
  one of them stands the chapel of Saint-Bénézet, a small Romanesque
  building. Avignon is still encircled by the ramparts built by the popes
  in the 14th century, which offer one of the finest examples of medieval
  fortification in existence. The walls, which are of great strength, are
  surmounted by machicolated battlements, flanked at intervals by
  thirty-nine massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of
  which date from the 14th century. The whole is surrounded by a line of
  pleasant boulevards. The life of the town is almost confined to the Place
  de l'Hôtel de Ville and the Cours de la République, which leads out of it
  and extends to the ramparts. Elsewhere the streets are narrow, quiet,
  and, for the most part, badly paved. At the northern extremity of the
  town a precipitous rock, the Rocher des Doms, rises from the river's edge
  and forms a plateau stretching southwards nearly to the Place de l'Hôtel
  de Ville. Its summit is occupied by a public garden and, to the south of
  this, by the cathedral of Notre-Dame des Doms and the Palace of the
  Popes. The cathedral is a Romanesque building, mainly of the 12th
  century, the most prominent feature of which is the gilded statue of the
  Virgin which surmounts the western tower. Among the many works of art in
  the interior, the most beautiful is the mausoleum of Pope John XXII., a
  masterpiece of Gothic <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>[v.03 p.0064]</span>carving of the 14th century. The
  cathedral is almost dwarfed by the Palace of the Popes, a sombre
  assemblage of buildings, which rises at its side and covers a space of
  more than 1¼ acres. Begun in 1316 by John XXII., it was continued by
  succeeding popes until 1370, and is in the Gothic style; in its
  construction everything has been sacrificed to strength, and though the
  effect is imposing, the place has the aspect rather of a fortress than of
  a palace. It was for long used as a barracks and prison, to the
  exigencies of which the fine apartments were ruthlessly adapted, but it
  is now municipal property. Among the minor churches of the town are St
  Pierre, which has a graceful façade and richly carved doors, St Didier
  and St Agricol, all three of Gothic architecture. The most notable of the
  civil buildings are the hôtel de ville, a modern building with a belfry
  of the 14th century, and the old Hôtel des Monnaies, the papal mint which
  was built in 1610 and is now used as a music-school. The Calvet Museum,
  so named after F. Calvet, physician, who in 1810 left his collections to
  the town, is rich in inscriptions, bronzes, glass and other antiquities,
  and in sculptures and paintings. The library has over 140,000 volumes.
  The town has a statue of a Persian, Jean Althen, who in 1765 introduced
  the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple and is
  still an important branch of local trade. In 1873 John Stuart Mill died
  at Avignon, and is buried in the cemetery. For the connexion of Petrarch
  with the town see <span class="sc">Petrarch</span>.</p>

  <p>Avignon is subject to violent winds, of which the most disastrous is
  the <i>mistral</i>. The popular proverb is, however, somewhat
  exaggerated, <i>Avenio ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento
  fastidiosa</i> (windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind,
  wind-pestered when there is).</p>

  <p>Avignon is the seat of an archbishop and has tribunals of first
  instance and of commerce, a council of trade-arbitrators, a lycée, and
  training college, a chamber of commerce and a branch of the Bank of
  France. It is in the midst of a fertile district, in the products of
  which it has a large trade, and has flour-mills, distilleries, oil-works
  and leather-works, manufactures soap, chemicals and liquorice, and is
  well known for its sarsanet and other fabrics.</p>

  <p>Avignon (<i>Avenio</i>) was an important town of the Gallic tribe of
  the Cavares, and under the Romans one of the leading cities of Gallia
  Narbonensis. Severely harassed during the barbarian invasions and by the
  Saracens, it was, in later times, attached successively to the kingdoms
  of Burgundy and of Arles and to the domains of the counts of Provence and
  of Toulouse and of Forcalquier. At the end of the 12th century it became
  a republic, but in 1226 was taken and dismantled by Louis VIII. as
  punishment for its support of the Albigenses, and in 1251 was forced to
  submit to the counts of Toulouse and Provence. In 1309 the city was
  chosen by Clement V. as his residence, and from that time till 1377 was
  the papal seat. In 1348 the city was sold by Joanna, countess of
  Provence, to Clement VI. After Gregory XI. had migrated to Rome, two
  antipopes, Clement VII. and Benedict XIII., resided at Avignon, from
  which the latter was expelled in 1408. The town remained in the
  possession of the popes, who governed it by means of legates, till its
  annexation by the National Assembly in 1791, though during this interval
  several kings of France made efforts to unite it with their dominions. In
  1791 conflicts between the adherents of the Papacy and the Republicans
  led to much bloodshed. In 1815 Marshal Brune was assassinated in the town
  by the adherents of the royalist party. The bishopric, founded in the 3rd
  century, became an archbishopric in 1475.</p>

  <p><b>ÁVILA, GIL GONZALEZ DE</b> (<i>c.</i> 1577-1658), Spanish
  biographer and antiquary, was born and died at Ávila. He was made
  historiographer of Castile in 1612, and of the Indies in 1641. Of his
  numerous works, the most valuable are his <i>Teatro de las Grandezas des
  Madrid</i> (Madrid, 1623, sqq.), and his <i>Teatro Eclesiastico</i>,
  descriptive of the metropolitan churches and cathedrals of Castile, with
  lives of the prelates (Madrid, 1645-1653, 4 vols. 4to).</p>

  <p><b>ÁVILA,</b> a province of central Spain, one of the modern divisions
  of the kingdom of Old Castile; bounded on the N. by Valladolid, E. by
  Segovia and Madrid, S. by Toledo and Cáceres, and W. by Salamanca. Pop.
  (1900) 200,457; area, 2570 sq. m. Ávila is naturally divided into two
  sections, differing completely in soil, climate, productions and social
  economy. The northern portion is generally level; the soil is of
  indifferent quality, strong and marly in a few places, but rocky in all
  the valleys of the Sierra de Ávila; and the climate alternates from
  severe cold in winter to extreme heat in summer. The population of this
  part is mainly agricultural. The southern division is one mass of rugged
  granitic sierras, interspersed, however, with sheltered and well-watered
  valleys, abounding with rich vegetation. The winter here, especially in
  the elevated region of the Paramera and the waste lands of Ávila, is long
  and severe, but the climate is not unhealthy. In this region
  stock-breeding is an important industry. The principal mountain chains
  are the Guadarrama, separating this province from Madrid; the Paramera
  and Sierra de Ávila, west of the Guadarrama; and the vast wall of the
  Sierra de Gredos along the southern frontier, where its outstanding peaks
  rise to 6000 or even 8000 ft. The ridges which ramify from the Paramera
  are covered with valuable forests of beeches, oaks and firs, presenting a
  striking contrast to the bare peaks of the Sierra de Gredos. The
  principal rivers are the Alberche and Tietar, belonging to the basin of
  the Tagus, and the Tórmes, Trabáncos and Adaja, belonging to that of the
  Douro. The mountains contain silver, copper, iron, lead and coal, but
  their mineral wealth has been exaggerated, and at the beginning of the
  20th century mining had practically been abandoned. Quarries of fine
  marble and jasper exist in the district of Arenas. The province declined
  in wealth and population during the 18th and 19th centuries, a result due
  less to the want of activity on the part of the inhabitants than to the
  oppressive manorial and feudal rights and the strict laws of entail and
  mortmain, which acted as barriers to progress.</p>

  <p>Towards the close of this period many improvements were introduced,
  although the want of irrigation is still keenly felt. Wide tracts of
  waste land were planted with pinewoods by the ducal house of Medina
  Sidonia. The main roads are fairly good; and Ávila, the capital, is
  connected by rail with Salamanca, Valladolid and Madrid; but in many
  parts of the province the means of communication are defective. Except
  Ávila there are no important towns. The principal production is the wool
  of the merino sheep, which at one time yielded an immense revenue. Game
  is plentiful, and the rivers abound in fish, specially trout. Olives,
  chestnuts and grapes are grown, and silk-worms are kept. There is little
  trade, and the manufactures are few, consisting chiefly of copper
  utensils, lime, soap, cloth, paper and combs. The state of elementary
  education is comparatively good, rather more than two-thirds of the
  population being able to read and write, and the ratio of crime is
  proportionately low.</p>

  <p><b>ÁVILA</b> (anc. <i>Abula</i> or <i>Avela</i>), the capital of the
  province described above; on the right bank of the river Adaja, 54 m. W.
  by N. of Madrid, by the Madrid-Valladolid railway. Pop. (1900) 11,885.
  The city is built on the flat summit of a rocky hill, which rises
  abruptly in the midst of a veritable wilderness; a brown, arid, treeless
  table-land, strewn with immense grey boulders, and shut in by lofty
  mountains. The ancient walls of Ávila, constructed of brown granite, and
  surmounted by a breastwork, with eighty-six towers and nine gateways, are
  still in excellent repair; but a large part of the city lies beyond their
  circuit. Ávila is the seat of a bishop, and contains several
  ecclesiastical buildings of high interest. The Gothic cathedral, said by
  tradition to date from 1107, but probably of 13th or 14th century
  workmanship, has the appearance of a fortress, with embattled walls and
  two solid towers. It contains many interesting sculptures and paintings,
  besides one especially fine silver pyx, the work of Juan de Arphe, dating
  from 1571. The churches of San Vicente, San Pedro, Santo Tomás and San
  <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[v.03
  p.0065]</span>Segundo are, in their main features, Romanesque of the 15th
  century, although parts of the beautiful San Vicente, and of San Pedro,
  may be as old as the 12th century. Especially noteworthy is the marble
  monument in Santo Tomás, carved by the 15th-century Florentine sculptor
  Domenico Fancelli, over the tomb of Prince John (d. 1497), the only son
  of Ferdinand and Isabella. The convent and church of Santa Teresa mark
  the supposed birthplace of the saint whose name they bear (<i>c</i>.
  1515-1582) Ávila also possesses an old Moorish castle (<i>alcázar</i>)
  used as barracks, a foundling hospital, infirmary, military academy, and
  training schools for teachers of both sexes. From 1482 to 1807 it was
  also the seat of a university. It has a considerable trade in
  agricultural products, leather, pottery, hats, linen and cotton
  goods.</p>

  <p><b>AVILA Y ZUNIGA, LUIS DE</b> (<i>c.</i> 1490-<i>c.</i> 1560),
  Spanish historian, was born at Placentia. He was probably of low origin,
  but married a wealthy heiress of the family of Zuniga, whose name he
  added to his own. He rose rapidly in the favour of the emperor Charles
  V., served as ambassador to Rome, and was made grand commander of the
  order of the Knights of Alcantara. He accompanied the emperor to Africa
  in 1541, and having served during the war of the league of Schmalkalden,
  wrote a history of this war entitled <i>Commentarios de la guerra de
  Alemaña, hecha de Carlos V en el año de 1546 y 1547.</i> This was first
  printed in 1548, and becoming very popular was translated into French,
  Dutch, German, Italian and Latin. As may be expected from the author's
  intimacy with Charles, the book is very partial to the emperor, and its
  misrepresentations have been severely criticized.</p>

  <p><b>AVILÉS, PEDRO MENÉNDEZ DE</b> (1519-1574), Spanish seaman, founder
  of St Augustine, Florida, was born at Avilés in Asturias on the 15th of
  February 1519. His family were gentry, and he was one of nineteen
  brothers and sisters. At the age of fourteen he ran away to sea, and was
  engaged till he was thirty in a life of adventure as a corsair. In 1549
  during peace between France and Spain he was commissioned by the emperor
  Charles V. to clear the north coast of Spain and the Canaries of French
  pirates. In 1554 he was appointed captain-general of the "flota" or
  convoy which carried the trade between Spain and America. The appointment
  was made by the emperor over the head and against the will of the Casa de
  Contratacion, or governing board of the American trade. In this year, and
  before he sailed to America, Avilés accompanied the prince of Spain,
  afterwards Philip II., to England, where he had gone to marry Queen Mary.
  As commander of the flota he displayed a diligence, and achieved a degree
  of success in bringing back treasure, which earned him the hearty
  approval of the emperor. But his devotion to the imperial service, and
  his steady refusal to receive bribes as the reward for permitting
  breaches of the regulations, made him unpopular with the merchants, while
  his high-handed ways offended the Casa de Contratacion. Reappointed
  commander in 1557, and knowing the hostility of the Casa, he applied for
  service elsewhere. The war with France in which Spain and England were
  allies was then in progress, and until the close of 1559 ample occupation
  was found for Avilés in bringing money and recruits from Spain to
  Flanders. When peace was restored he commanded the fleet which brought
  Philip II. back from the Low Countries to Spain. In 1560 he was again
  appointed to command the flota, and he made a most successful voyage to
  America and back, in that and the following year. His relations with the
  Casa de Contratacion were, however, as strained as ever. On his return
  from another voyage in 1563 he was arrested by order of the Casa, and was
  detained in prison for twenty months. What the charges brought against
  him were is not known. Avilés in a letter to the king avows his
  innocence, and he was finally discharged by the judges, but not until
  they had received two peremptory orders from the king to come to a
  decision.</p>

  <p>On his release he prepared to sail to the Bermudas to seek for his son
  Juan, who had been shipwrecked in the previous year. At that time the
  French Huguenots were engaged in endeavouring to plant a colony in
  Florida. As the country had been explored by the Spaniards they claimed
  it as theirs, and its position on the track of the home-coming trade of
  Mexico rendered its possession by any other power highly dangerous.
  Philip II. endeavoured to avert the peril by making an "<i>asiento</i>"
  or contract with Avilés, by which he advanced 15,000 ducats to the
  seaman, and constituted him proprietor of any colony which he could
  establish in Florida, on condition that the money was repaid. The
  contract was signed on the 20th of March 1565. Avilés sailed on the 28th
  of July of the same year with one vessel of 600 tons, ten sloops and 1500
  men. On the 28th of August he entered and named the Bay of St Augustine,
  and began a fort there. He took the French post of Fort Caroline on the
  20th of September 1565, and in October exterminated a body of Frenchmen
  who, under the Huguenot Jean Ribault, had arrived on the coast of Florida
  to relieve their colony. The Spanish commander, after slaying nearly all
  his prisoners, hung their bodies on trees, with the inscription, "Not as
  Frenchmen but as Lutherans." A French sea-captain named Dominique de
  Gourgues revenged the massacre by capturing in 1568 Fort San Mateo (as
  the Spanish had renamed Fort Caroline), and hanging the garrison, with
  the inscription, "Not as Spaniards but as murderers." Till 1567 Avilés
  remained in Florida, busy with his colony. In that year he returned to
  Spain. He made one more voyage to Florida, and died on the 17th of
  September 1574. Avilés married Maria de Solis, when very young, and left
  three daughters. His letters prove him to have been a pious and
  high-minded officer, who never imagined that he could be supposed by any
  honest man to have gone too far in massacring the Frenchmen, whom he
  regarded as pirates and heretics.</p>

  <p><b>AVILÉS,</b> or <span class="sc">San Nicolás de Avilés</span> (the
  Roman <i>Flavionavia</i>), a seaport of northern Spain, in the province
  of Oviedo; on the Bay of Avilés, a winding inlet of the Bay of Biscay, 24
  m. by rail W. of Gijón. Pop. (1900) 12,763. Avilés is a picturesque and
  old-fashioned town, containing several ancient palaces and Gothic
  churches. The bay, which is crossed by a fine bridge at its narrow
  landward extremity, is the headquarters of a fishing fleet, and a port of
  call for many coasting vessels. Coal from the Oviedo mines is exported
  coastwise, and in 1904 the shipments from Avilés for the first time
  exceeded those from Gijón, reaching a total of more than 290,000 tons.
  Glass and coarse linen and woollen stuffs are manufactured; and there are
  valuable stone quarries in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p><b>AVIZANDUM</b> (from Late Lat. <i>avizare</i>, to consider), a Scots
  law term; the judge "makes avizandum with a cause," <i>i.e.</i> takes
  time to consider his judgment.</p>

  <p><b>AVLONA</b> (anc. <i>Aulon</i>; Ital. <i>Valona</i>; Alb.
  <i>Vliona</i>), a town and seaport of Albania, Turkey, in the vilayet of
  Iannina. Pop. (1900) about 6000. Avlona occupies an eminence near the
  Gulf of Avlona, an inlet of the Adriatic, almost surrounded by mountains.
  The port is the best on the Albanian coast, and the nearest to Italy. It
  is protected by the island of Saseno, the ancient Saso, and by Cape
  Glossa, the northernmost headland of the Acroceraunian mountains. It is
  regularly visited by steamers from Trieste, Fiume, Brindisi, and other
  Austro-Hungarian and Italian ports, as well as by many small Greek and
  Turkish coasters. The cable and telegraph line from Otranto, in Italy, to
  Constantinople, has an important station here. The town is about 1½ m.
  from the sea, and has rather a pleasant appearance with its minarets and
  its palace, surrounded with gardens and olive-groves. Valonia, a material
  largely used by tanners, is the pericarp of an acorn obtained in the
  neighbouring oak-woods, and derives its name from Valona. The surrounding
  district is mainly agricultural and pastoral, producing oats, maize,
  cotton, olive oil, cattle, sheep, skins, hides and butter. All these
  commodities are exported in considerable quantities, besides bitumen,
  which is obtained from a mine worked by a French <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[v.03 p.0066]</span>company. The
  imports are woollen and cotton piece-goods, metals and petroleum.</p>

  <p>Avlona played an important part in the wars between the Normans and
  the Byzantines, during the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1464 it was taken
  by the Ottomans; and after being in Venetian possession in 1690, was
  restored to them in 1691. In 1851 it suffered severely from an
  earthquake.</p>

  <p><b>AVOCA,</b> or <span class="sc">Ovoca</span>, <b>VALE OF,</b> a
  mountain glen of county Wicklow, Ireland, in the south-eastern part of
  the county, formed by the junction of the small rivers Avonmore and
  Avonbeg, which, rising in the central highlands of the county, form with
  their united waters the Ovoca river, flowing south and south-east to the
  Irish Sea at Arklow. The vale would doubtless rank only as one among the
  many beautiful glens of the district, but that it has obtained a lasting
  celebrity through one of the <i>Irish Melodies</i> of the poet Thomas
  Moore, in which its praises are sung. It is through this song that the
  form "Avoca" is most familiar, although the name is locally spelt
  "Ovoca." The glen is narrow and densely wooded. Its beauty is somewhat
  marred by the presence of lead and copper mines, and by the main line of
  the Dublin &amp; South Eastern railway, on which Ovoca station, midway in
  the vale, is 42¾ m. south of Dublin. Of the two "meetings of the waters"
  (the upper, of the Avonmore and Avonbeg, and the lower, of the Aughrim
  with the Ovoca) the upper, near the fine seat of Castle Howard, is that
  which inspired the poet. At Avondale, above the upper "meeting," by the
  Avonmore, Charles Stewart Parnell was born.</p>

  <p><b>AVOCADO PEAR,</b> the fruit of the tree <i>Persea gratissima</i>,
  which grows in the West Indies and elsewhere; the flesh is of a soft and
  buttery consistency and highly esteemed. The name <i>avocado</i>, the
  Spanish for "advocate," is a sound-substitute for the Aztec
  <i>ahuacatl</i>; it is also corrupted into "alligator-pear."
  <i>Avocato</i>, <i>avigato</i>, <i>abbogada</i> are variants.</p>

  <p><b>AVOGADRO, AMEDEO, CONTE DI QUAREGNA</b> (1776-1856), Italian
  physicist, was born at Turin on the 9th of June 1776, and died there on
  the 9th of July 1856. He was for many years professor of higher physics
  in Turin University. He published many physical memoirs on electricity,
  the dilatation of liquids by heat, specific heats, capillary attraction,
  atomic volumes &amp;c. as well as a treatise in 4 volumes on <i>Fisica di
  corpi ponderabili</i> (1837-1841). But he is chiefly remembered for his
  "Essai d'une manière de déterminer les masses relatives des molécules
  élémentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent
  dans les combinaisons" (<i>Journ. de Phys.</i>, 1811), in which he
  enunciated the hypothesis known by his name (Avogadro's rule) that under
  the same conditions of temperature and pressure equal volumes of all
  gases contain the same number of smallest particles or molecules, whether
  those particles consist of single atoms or are composed of two or more
  atoms of the same or different kinds.</p>

  <p><b>AVOIDANCE</b> (from "avoid," properly to make empty or void, in
  current usage, to keep away from, to shun; the word "avoid" is adapted
  from the O. Fr. <i>esvuidier</i> or <i>évider</i>, to empty out,
  <i>voide</i>, modern <i>vide</i>, empty, connected with Lat.
  <i>vacuus</i>), the action of making empty, void or null, hence, in law,
  invalidation, annulment (see <span class="sc">Confession and
  Avoidance</span>); also the becoming void or vacant, hence in
  ecclesiastical law a term signifying the vacancy of a benefice&mdash;that
  it is <i>void</i> of an incumbent. In general use, the word means the
  action of keeping away from anything, shunning or avoiding.</p>

  <p><b>AVOIRDUPOIS,</b> or <span class="sc">Averdupois</span> (from the
  French <i>avoir de pois</i>, goods of weight), the name of a system of
  weights used in Great Britain and America for all commodities except the
  precious metals, gems and medicines. The foundation of the system is the
  grain. A cubic inch of water weighs 252.458 grains. Of this grain 7000
  now (see <span class="sc">Weights and Measures</span>) make a pound
  avoirdupois. This pound is divided into 16 oz., and these ounces into 16
  drachms.</p>

  <p><b>AVON,</b> the name of several rivers in England and elsewhere. The
  word is Celtic, appearing in Welsh (very frequently) as <i>afon</i>, in
  Manx as <i>aon</i>, and in Gaelic as <i>abhuinn</i> (pronounced
  <i>avain</i>), and is radically identical with the Sanskrit <i>ap</i>,
  water, and the Lat. <i>aqua</i> and <i>amnis</i>. The root appears more
  or less disguised in a vast number of river names all over the Celtic
  area in Europe. Thus, besides such forms as <i>Evan</i>, <i>Aune</i>,
  <i>Anne</i>, <i>Ive</i>, <i>Auney</i>, <i>Inney,</i> &amp;c., in the
  British Islands, <i>Aff</i>, <i>Aven</i>, <i>Avon</i>, <i>Aune</i> appear
  in Brittany and elsewhere in France, <i>Avenza</i> and <i>Avens</i> in
  Italy, <i>Avia</i> in Portugal, and <i>Avono</i> in Spain; while the
  terminal syllable of a large proportion of the Latinized names of French
  rivers, such as the <i>Sequana</i>, the <i>Matrona</i> and the
  <i>Garumna</i>, seems originally to have been the same word. The names
  Punj<i>ab</i>, Do<i>ab</i>, &amp;c., show the root in a clearer
  shape.</p>

  <p>In England the following are the principal rivers of this name.</p>

  <p>1. The <span class="sc">East</span> or <span class="sc">Hampshire
  Avon</span> rises in Wiltshire south of Marlborough, and watering the
  Vale of Pewsey collects feeders from the high downs between Marlborough
  and Devizes. Breaching the high ground of Salisbury Plain, it passes
  Amesbury, and following a very sinuous course reaches Salisbury. Here it
  receives on the east bank the waters of the Bourne, and on the west those
  of the Wylye. With a more direct course, and in a widening, fertile
  valley it continues past Downton, Fordingbridge and Ringwood, skirting
  the New Forest on the west, to Christchurch, where it receives the Stour
  from the west, and 2½ m. lower enters the English Channel through the
  broad but narrow-mouthed Christchurch harbour. The length, excluding
  lesser sinuosities, is about 60 m., Salisbury being 35 m. above the
  mouth. The total fall is rather over 500 ft., and that from Salisbury
  about 140 ft. The river is of no commercial value for navigation. It
  abounds in loach, and there are valuable salmon fisheries. The drainage
  area is 1132 sq. m.</p>

  <p>2. The <span class="sc">Lower</span> or <span class="sc">Bristol
  Avon</span> rises on the eastern slope of the Cotteswold Hills in
  Gloucestershire, collecting the waters of several streams south of
  Tetbury and east of Malmesbury. It flows east and south in a wide curve,
  through a broad upper valley past Chippenham and Melksham, after which it
  turns abruptly west to Bradford-on-Avon, receives the waters of the Frome
  from the south, and enters the beautiful narrow valley in which lie Bath
  and Bristol. Below Bristol the valley becomes the Clifton Gorge, famous
  for its wooded cliffs and for the Clifton (<i>q.v.</i>) suspension bridge
  which bestrides it. The cliffs and woods have been so far disfigured by
  quarries that public feeling was aroused, and in 1904 an "Avon Gorge
  Committee" was appointed to report to the corporation of Bristol on the
  possibility of preserving the beauties of the locality. The Avon finally
  enters the estuary of the Severn at Avonmouth, though it can hardly be
  reckoned as a tributary of that river. From Bristol downward the river is
  one of the most important commercial waterways in England, as giving
  access to that great port. The Kennet and Avon Canal, between Reading and
  the Avon, follows the river closely from Bradford down to Bath, where it
  enters it by a descent of seven locks. The length of the river, excluding
  minor sinuosities, is about 75 m., the distance from Bradford to Bath
  being 10 m., thence to Bristol 12 m., and thence to the mouth 8 m. The
  total fall is between 500 and 600 ft., but it is only 235 ft. from
  Malmesbury. The drainage area is 891 sq. miles.</p>

  <p>3. The <span class="sc">Upper Avon</span>, also called the
  Warwickshire, and sometimes the "Shakespeare" Avon from its associations
  with the poet's town of Stratford on its banks, is an eastern tributary
  of the Severn. It rises near Naseby in Northamptonshire, and, with a
  course of about 100 m. joins the Severn immediately below Tewkesbury in
  Gloucestershire. Its early course is south-westerly to Rugby, thereafter
  it runs west and south-west to Warwick, receiving the Leam on the east.
  Its general direction thereafter remains south-westerly, and it flows
  past Stratford-on-Avon, receives the Stour on the south and the Arrow on
  the north and thence past Evesham and Pershore to Tewkesbury. The valley
  is always broad, and especially from Warwick downward, through the Vale
  of Evesham, the scenery is very beautiful, the rich valley being flanked
  by the bold Cotteswold Hills on <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>[v.03 p.0067]</span>the south and by the wooded slopes
  of the Arden district of Warwickshire on the north. The view of Warwick
  Castle, rising from the wooded banks of the river, is unsurpassed, and
  the positions of Stratford and Evesham are admirable. The river is
  locked, and carries a small trade up to Evesham, 28 m. from Tewkesbury;
  the locks from Evesham upward to Stratford (17 m.) are decayed, but the
  weirs, and mill-dams still higher, afford many navigable reaches to
  pleasure boats. The total fall of the river is about 500 ft.; from Rugby
  about 230 ft., and from Warwick 120 ft. The river abounds in coarse
  fish.</p>

  <p>Among other occurrences of the name of Avon in Great Britain there may
  be noted&mdash;in England, a stream flowing south-east from Dartmoor in
  Devonshire to the English Channel; in South Wales, the stream which has
  its mouth at Aberavon in Glamorganshire; in Scotland, tributaries of the
  Clyde, the Spey and the Forth.</p>

  <p><b>AVONIAN,</b> in geology, the name proposed by Dr A. Vaughan in 1905
  (<i>Q.J.G.S.</i> vol. lxi. p. 264) for the rocks of Lower Carboniferous
  age in the Avon gorge at Bristol. The Avonian stage appears to embrace
  precisely the same rocks and fossil-zones as the earlier designation
  "Dinantien" (see <span class="sc">Carboniferous System</span>); but its
  substages, being founded upon different local conditions and a different
  interpretation of the zonal fossils, do not correspond exactly with those
  of the French and Belgian geologists.</p>

  <p><b>AVONMORE, BARRY YELVERTON,</b> <span class="sc">1st Viscount</span>
  (1736-1805), Irish judge, was born in 1736. He was the eldest son of
  Frank Yelverton of Blackwater, Co. Cork. Educated at Trinity College,
  Dublin, he was for some years an assistant master under Andrew Buck in
  the Hibernian Academy. In 1761 he married Miss Mary Nugent, a lady of
  some fortune, and was then enabled to read for the bar. He was called in
  1764, his success was rapid, and he took silk eight years afterwards. He
  sat in the Irish parliament as member successively for the boroughs of
  Donegal and Carrickfergus, becoming attorney-general in 1782, but was
  elevated to the bench as chief baron of the exchequer in 1783. He was
  created (Irish) Baron Avonmore in 1795, and in 1800 (Irish) viscount.
  Among his colleagues at the Irish bar Yelverton was a popular and
  charming companion. Of insignificant appearance, he owed his early
  successes to his remarkable eloquence, which made a great impression on
  his contemporaries; as a judge, he was inclined to take the view of the
  advocate rather than that of the impartial lawyer. He gave his support to
  Grattan and the Whigs during the greater part of his parliamentary
  career, but in his latter days became identified with the court party and
  voted for the union, for which his viscounty was a reward. He had three

  arrondissement in the department of Manche, 87 m. S. of Cherbourg on the
  Western railway. Pop. (1906) 7186. It stands on a wooded hill, its
  botanical gardens commanding a fine view westward of the bay and rock of
  St Michel. At the foot of the hill flows the river Sée, which at high
  tide is navigable from the sea. The town is surrounded by avenues, which
  occupy the site of the ancient ramparts, remains of which are to be seen
  on the north side. Avranches was from 511 to 1790 a bishop's see, held at
  the end of the 17th century by the scholar Daniel Huet; and its
  cathedral, destroyed as insecure in the time of the first French
  Revolution, was the finest in Normandy. Its site is now occupied by an
  open square, one stone remaining to mark the spot where Henry II. of
  England received absolution for the murder of Thomas Becket. The churches
  of Notre-Dame des Champs and St Saturnin are modern buildings in the
  Gothic style. The ancient episcopal palace is now used as a court of
  justice; a public library is kept in the hôtel de ville. In the public
  gardens there is a statue of General Jean Marie Valhubert, killed at
  Austerlitz. Avranches is seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of
  first instance and a communal college. Leather-dressing is the chief
  industry; steam-sawing, brewing and dyeing are also carried on, and
  horticulture flourishes in the environs. Trade is in cider, cattle,
  butter, flowers and fruit, and there are salmon and other fisheries.</p>

  <p>Avranches, an important military station of the Romans, was in the
  middle ages chief place of a county of the duchy of Normandy. It
  sustained several sieges, the most noteworthy of which, in 1591, was the
  result of its opposition to Henry IV. In 1639 Avranches was the focus of
  the peasant revolt against the salt-tax, known as the revolt of the
  Nu-pieds.</p>

  <p><b>AWADIA</b> and <b>FADNIA,</b> two small nomad tribes of pure Arab
  blood living in the Bayuda desert, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, between the
  wells of Jakdul and Metemma. They are often incorrectly classed as
  Ja&rsquo;alin. They own numbers of horses and cattle, the former of the
  black Dongola breed. At the battle of Abu Klea (17th of January 1885)
  they were conspicuous for their courage in riding against the British
  square.</p>

  <p><b>AWAJI,</b> an island belonging to Japan, situated at the eastern
  entrance of the Inland Sea, having a length of 32 m., an extreme breadth
  of 16 m., and an area of 218 sq. m., with a population of about 190,000.
  It is separated on the south from the island of Shikoku by the Naruto
  channel, through which, in certain conditions of the tide, a remarkable
  torrential current is set up. The island is celebrated for its exquisite
  scenery, and also for the fact that it is traditionally reputed to have
  been the first of the Japanese islands created by the deities Izanagi and
  Izanami. The loftiest peak is Yuruuba-yama (1998 ft.), the most
  picturesque Sen-zan (1519 ft.). Awaji is noted for a peculiar manufacture
  of pottery.</p>

  <p><b>AWE, LOCH,</b> the longest freshwater lake in Scotland, situated in
  mid-Argyllshire, 116 ft. above the sea, with an area of nearly 16 sq. m.
  It has a N.E. to S.W. direction and is fully 23 m. long from Kilchurn
  Castle to Ford, its breadth varying from &#x2153; of a mile to 3 m. at
  its upper end, where it takes the shape of a crescent, one arm of which
  runs towards Glen Orchy, the other to the point where the river Awe
  leaves the lake. The two ends of the loch are wholly dissimilar in
  character, the scenery of the upper extremity being majestic, while that
  of the lower half is pastoral and tame. Of its numerous islands the
  best-known is Inishail, containing ruins of a church and convent, which
  was suppressed at the Reformation. At the extreme north-eastern end of
  the lake, on an islet which, when the water is low, becomes part of the
  mainland, stand the imposing ruins of Kilchurn Castle. Its romantic
  surroundings have made this castle a favourite subject of the landscape
  painter. Dalmally, about 2 m. from the loch, is one of the pleasantest
  villages in the Highlands and has a great vogue in midsummer. The river
  Awe, issuing from the north-western horn of the loch, affords excellent
  trout and salmon fishing.</p>

  <p><b>AXHOLME,</b> an island in the north-west part of Lincolnshire,
  England, lying between the rivers Trent, Idle and Don, and isolated by
  drainage channels connected with these rivers. It consists mainly of a
  plateau of slight elevation, rarely exceeding 100 ft., and comprises the
  parishes of Althorpe, Belton, Epworth, Haxey, Luddington, Owston and
  Crowle; the total area being about 47,000 acres. At a very early period
  it would appear to have been covered with forest; but this having been in
  great measure destroyed, it became in great part a swamp. In 1627 King
  Charles I., who was lord of the island, entered into a contract with
  Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutchman, for reclaiming the meres and marshes,
  and rendering them fit for tillage. This undertaking led to the
  introduction of a large number of Flemish workmen, who settled in the
  district, and, in spite of the violent measures adopted by the English
  peasantry to expel them, retained their ground in sufficient numbers to
  affect the physical appearance and the accent of the inhabitants to this
  day. The principal towns in the isle are Crowle (pop. 2769) and Epworth.
  The Axholme joint light railway runs north and south through the isle,
  connecting Goole with Haxey junction; and the Great Northern, Great
  Eastern and Great Central lines also afford communications. The land is
  extremely fertile. The name, properly Axeyholm (cf. Haxey), is hybrid,
  <i>Ax</i> being the Celtic <i>uisg</i>, water; <i>ey</i> the Anglo-Saxon
  for island; and <i>holm</i> the Norse word with the same
  signification.</p>

  <p><b>AXILE,</b> or <span class="sc">Axial</span>, a term (= related to

  <p><b>AXINITE,</b> a mineral consisting of a complex aluminium and
  calcium boro-silicate with a small amount of basic hydrogen; the calcium
  is partly replaced in varying amounts by ferrous iron and manganese, and
  the aluminium by ferric iron: the formula is
  HCa<sub>3</sub>BAl<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. The mineral
  was named (from <span title="axinê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&xi;&#x1F77;&nu;&eta;</span>, an axe) by R.&nbsp;J. Haüy in 1799, on
  account of the characteristic thin wedge-like form of its anorthic
  crystals. The colour is usually clove-brown, but rarely it has a violet
  tinge (on this account the mineral was named yanolite, meaning violet
  stone, by J.&nbsp;C. Delamétherie in 1792). The best specimens are afforded by
  the beautifully developed transparent glassy crystals, found with albite,
  prehnite and quartz, in a zone of amphibolite and chlorite-schists at Le
  Bourg d'Oisans in Dauphiné. It is found in the greenstone and
  hornblende-schists of Batallack Head near St Just in Cornwall, and in
  diabase in the Harz; and small ones in Maine and in Northampton county,
  Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Large crystals have also been found in Japan. In its
  occurrence in basic rather than in acid eruptive rocks, axinite differs
  from the boro-silicate tourmaline, which is usually found in granite. The
  specific gravity is 3.28. The hardness of 6½-7, combined with the colour
  and transparency, renders axinite applicable for use as a gemstone, the
  Dauphiné crystals being occasionally cut for this purpose.</p>

  <p><b>AXIOM</b> (Gr. <span title="axiôma" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&xi;&#x1F77;&omega;&mu;&alpha;</span>), a general proposition or
  principle accepted as self-evident, either absolutely or within a
  particular sphere of thought. Each special science has its own axioms
  (cf. the Aristotelian <span title="archai" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&#x1F77;</span>, "first principles") which,
  however, are sometimes susceptible of proof in another wider science. The
  Greek word was probably confined by Plato to mathematical axioms, but
  Aristotle (<i>Anal. Post.</i> i. 2) gave it also the wider significance
  of the ultimate principles of thought which are behind all special
  sciences (<i>e.g.</i> the principle of contradiction). These are
  apprehended solely by the mind, which may, however, be led to them by an
  inductive process. After Aristotle, the term was used by the Stoics and
  the school of Ramus for a proposition simply, and Bacon (<i>Nov.
  Organ.</i> i. 7) used it of any general proposition. The word was
  reintroduced in modern philosophy probably by René Descartes (or by his
  followers) who, in the search for a definite self-evident principle as
  the basis of a new philosophy, naturally turned to the familiar science
  of mathematics. The axiom of Cartesianism is, therefore, the <i>Cogito
  ergo sum</i>. Kant still further narrowed the meaning to include only
  self-evident (intuitive) synthetic propositions, <i>i.e.</i> of space and
  time. The nature of axiomatic certainty is part of the fundamental
  problem of logic and metaphysics. Those who deny the possibility of all
  non-empirical knowledge naturally hold that every axiom is ultimately
  based on observation. For the Euclidian axioms see <span
  class="sc">Geometry</span>.</p>

  <p><b>AXIS</b> (Lat. for "axle"), a word having the same meaning as axle,
  and also used with many extensions of this primary meaning. It denotes
  the imaginary line about which a body or system of bodies rotates, or a
  line about which a body or action is symmetrically disposed. In geometry,
  and in geometrical crystallography, the term denotes a line which serves
  to aid the orientation of a figure. In anatomy, it is, among other uses,
  applied to the second cervical vertebra, and in botany it means the
  stem.</p>

  <p><b>AXLE</b> (in Mid. Eng. <i>axel-tre</i>, from O. Norweg.
  <i>öxull-tre</i>, cognate with the O. Eng. <i>æxe</i> or <i>eaxe</i>, and
  connected with Sansk. <i>áksha</i>, Gr. <span title="axôn" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&xi;&omega;&nu;</span>, and Lat. <i>axis</i>), the pin or
  spindle on which a wheel turns. In carriages the axle-tree is the bar on
  which the wheels are mounted, the axles being strictly its thinner
  rounded prolongations on which they actually turn. The pins which pass
  through the ends of the axles and keep the wheels from slipping off are
  known as axle-pins or "linch-pins," "linch" being a corruption, due to
  confusion with "link," of the Old English word for "axle," <i>lynis</i>,
  cf. Ger. <i>Lünse</i>.</p>

  <p><b>AX-LES-THERMES,</b> a watering place of south-western France, in
  the department of Ariège, at the confluence of the Ariège with three
  tributaries, 26 m. S.S.E. of Foix by rail. Pop. (1906) 1179. Ax (Aquae),
  situated at a height of 2300 ft., is well known for its warm sulphur
  springs (77°-172° F.), of which there are about sixty. The waters, which
  were used by the Romans, are efficacious in the treatment of rheumatism,
  skin diseases and other maladies.</p>

  <p><b>AXMINSTER,</b> a market-town in the Honiton parliamentary division
  of Devonshire, England, on the river Axe, 27 m. E. by N. of Exeter by the
  London &amp; South-Western railway. Pop. (1901) 2906. The minster,
  dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, illustrates every style of architecture
  from Norman to Perpendicular. There are in the chancel two freestone
  effigies, perhaps of the 14th century, besides three sedilia, and a
  piscina under arches. Axminster was long celebrated for the admirable
  quality of its carpets, which were woven by hand, like tapestry. Their
  manufacture was established in 1755. Their name is preserved, but since
  the seat of this industry was removed to Wilton near Salisbury, the
  inhabitants of Axminster have found employment in brush factories, corn
  mills, timber yards and an iron foundry. Cloth, drugget, cotton, leather,
  gloves and tapes are also made. Coaxdon House, the birthplace in 1602 of
  Sir Symonds d'Ewes, the Puritan historian, is about 2 m. distant, and was
  formerly known as St Calyst.</p>

  <p>Axminster (Axemystre) derives its name from the river Axe and from the
  old abbey church or minster said to have been built by King Æthelstan.
  The situation of Axminster at the intersection of the two great ancient
  roads, Iknield Street and the Fosse Way, and also the numerous earthworks
  and hill-fortresses in the neighbourhood indicate a very early
  settlement. There is a tradition that the battle of Brunanburh was fought
  in the valley of the Axe, and that the bodies of the Danish princes who
  perished in action were buried in Axminster church. According to
  Domesday, Axminster was held by the king. In 1246 Reginald de Mohun, then
  lord of the manor, founded a Cistercian abbey at Newenham within the
  parish of Axminster, granting it a Saturday market and a fair on
  Midsummer day, and the next year made over to the monks from Beaulieu the
  manor and hundred of Axminster. The abbey was dissolved in 1539. The
  midsummer fair established by Reginald de Mohun is still held.</p>

  <p><b>AXOLOTL,</b> the Mexican name given to larvae salamanders of the
  genus <i>Amblystoma</i>. It required the extraordinary acumen of the
  great Cuvier at once to recognize, when the first specimens <!-- Page 69
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[v.03 p.0069]</span>of the
  <i>Gyrinus edulis</i> or <i>Axolotl</i> of Mexico were brought to him by
  Humboldt in the beginning of the 19th century, that these Batrachians
  were not really related to the Perennibranchiates, such as <i>Siren</i>
  and <i>Proteus</i>, with which he was well acquainted, but represented
  the larval form of some air-breathing salamander. Little heed was paid to
  his opinion by most systematists, and when, more than half a century
  later, the axolotl was found to breed in its branchiferous condition, the
  question seemed to be settled once for all against him, and the genus
  <i>Siredon</i>, as it was called by J. Wagler, was unanimously maintained
  and placed among the permanent gill-breathers.</p>

  <p>It seemed impossible to admit that an animal which lives for years
  without losing its gills, and is able to propagate in that state, could
  be anything but a perfect form. And yet subsequent discoveries, which
  followed in rapid succession, have established that <i>Siredon</i> is but
  the larval form of the salamander <i>Amblystoma</i>, a genus long known
  from various parts of North America; and Cuvier's conclusions now read
  much better than they did half a century after they were published.
  Before reviewing the history of these discoveries, it is desirable to say
  a few words of the characters of the axolotl (larval form) and of the
  <i>Amblystoma</i> (perfect or imago form).</p>

  <p>The axolotl has been known to the Mexicans from the remotest times, as
  an article of food regularly brought from neighbouring lakes to the
  Mexico market, its flesh being agreeable and wholesome. Francisco
  Hernandez (1514-1578) has alluded to it as <i>Gyrinus edulis</i> or
  <i>atolocatl</i>, and as <i>lusus aquarum</i>, <i>piscis ludicrus</i>, or
  <i>axolotl</i>, which latter name has remained in use, in Mexico and
  elsewhere, to the present day. But for its large size&mdash;it grows to a
  length of eleven inches&mdash;it is a nearly exact image of the British
  newt larvae. It has the same moderately long, plump body, with a low
  dorsal crest, the continuation of the membrane bordering the strongly
  compressed tail; a large thick head with small eyes without lids and with
  a large pendent upper lip; two pairs of well-developed limbs, with free
  digits; and above all, as the most characteristic feature, three large
  appendages on each side of the back of the head, fringed with filaments
  which, in their fullest development, remind one of black ostrich
  feathers. These are the external gills, through which the animal breathes
  the oxygen dissolved in the water. The jaws are provided with small teeth
  in several rows, and there is an elongate patch of further teeth on each
  side of the front of the palate (inserted on the vomerine and palatine
  bones). The colour is blackish, or of a dark olive-grey or brownish grey
  with round black spots or dots.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Amblystoma</i> was established by J.&nbsp;J. Tschudi in 1838
  for various salamanders from North America, which had previously been
  described as <i>Lacerta</i> or <i>Salamandra</i>, and which, so far as
  general appearance is concerned, differ little from the European
  salamanders. The body is smooth and shiny, with vertical grooves on the
  sides, the tail is but feebly compressed, the eye is moderately large and
  provided with movable lids, and the upper lip is nearly straight. But the
  dentition of the palate is very different; the small teeth, which are in
  a single row, as in the jaws, form a long transverse, continuous or
  interrupted series behind the inner nares or choanae. The animal leaves
  the water after completing its metamorphosis, the last stage of which is
  marked by the loss of the gills. One of the largest and most widely
  distributed species of this genus, which includes about twenty, is the
  <i>Amblystoma tigrinum</i>, an inhabitant of both the east and west of
  the United States and of a considerable part of the cooler parts of
  Mexico. It varies much in colour, but it may be described as usually
  brown or blackish, with more or less numerous yellow spots, sometimes
  arranged in transverse bands. It rarely exceeds a length of nine inches.
  This is the <i>Amblystoma</i> into which the axolotl has been ascertained
  to transform. It is generally admitted that the axolotls which were kept
  alive in Europe and were particularly abundant between 1870 and 1880 are
  all the descendants of a stock bred in Paris and distributed chiefly by
  dealers, originally, we believe, by the late P. Carbonnier. Close
  in-breeding without the infusion of new blood is probably the cause of
  the decrease in their numbers at the present day, specimens being more
  difficult to procure and fetching much higher prices than they did
  formerly, at least in England and in France.</p>

  <p>The original axolotls, from the vicinity of Mexico City, it is
  believed, arrived at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Paris, late in 1863.
  They were thirty-four in number, among which was an albino, and had been
  sent to that institution, together with a few other animals, by order of
  Marshal Forey, who was appointed commander-in-chief of the French
  expeditionary force to Mexico after the defeat of General Lorencez at
  Puebla (May 5th, 1862), and returned to France at the end of 1863, after
  having handed over the command to Marshal (then General) Bazaine. Six
  specimens (five males and one female) were given by the Société
  d'Acclimatation to Professor A. Duméril, the administrator of the reptile
  collection of the Jardin des Plantes, the living specimens of which were
  at that time housed in a very miserable structure, situated at a short
  distance from the comparatively sumptuous building which was erected some
  years later and opened to the public in 1874. Soon after their arrival at
  the Jardin d'Acclimatation, some of the axolotls spawned, but the eggs,
  not having been removed from the aquarium, were devoured by its
  occupants. At the same time, in the Jardin des Plantes, the single female
  axolotl also spawned, twice in succession, and a large number of young
  were successfully reared. This, it then seemed, solved the
  often-discussed question of the perennibranchiate nature of these
  Batrachians. But a year later, the second generation having reached
  sexual maturity, new broods were produced, and out of these some
  individuals lost their gills and dorsal crest, developed movable eyelids,
  changed their dentition, and assumed yellow spots,&mdash;in fact, took on
  all the characters of <i>Amblystoma tigrinum</i>. However, these
  transformed salamanders, of which twenty-nine were obtained from 1865 to
  1870, did not breed, although their branchiate brethren continued to do
  so very freely. It was not until 1876 that the axolotl in its
  <i>Amblystoma</i> state, offspring of several generations of
  perennibranchiates, was first observed to spawn, and this again took
  place in the reptile house of the Jardin des Plantes, as reported by
  Professor E. Blanchard.</p>

  <p>The original six specimens received in 1864 at the Jardin des Plantes,
  which had been carefully kept apart from their progeny, remained in the
  branchiate condition, and bred eleven times from 1865 to 1868, and, after
  a period of two years' rest, again in 1870. According to the report of
  Aug. Duméril, they and their offspring gave birth to 9000 or 10,000
  larvae during that period. So numerous were the axolotls that the Paris
  Museum was able to distribute to other institutions, as well as to
  dealers and private individuals, over a thousand examples, which found
  their way to all parts of Europe, and numberless specimens have been kept
  in England from 1866 to the present day. The first specimens exhibited in
  the London Zoological Gardens, in August 1864, were probably part of the
  original stock received from Mexico by the Société d'Acclimatation but do
  not appear to have bred.</p>

  <p>"White" axolotls, albinos of a pale flesh colour, with beautiful red
  gills, have also been kept in great numbers in England and on the
  continent. They are said to be all descendants of one albino male
  specimen received in the Paris Museum menagerie in 1866, which, paired
  with normal specimens in 1867 and 1868, produced numerous white
  offspring, which by selection have been fixed as a permanent race,
  without, according to L. Vaillant, showing any tendency to reversion. We
  are not aware of any but two of these albinos having ever turned into the
  perfect <i>Amblystoma</i> form, as happened in Paris in 1870, the
  albinism being retained.</p>

  <p>Thus we see that in our aquariums most of the axolotls remain in the
  branchiate condition, transformed individuals being on the whole very
  exceptional. Now it has been stated that in the lakes near Mexico City,
  where it was first discovered, the axolotl <i>never</i> transforms into
  an <i>Amblystoma</i>. This the present writer is inclined to doubt,
  considering that he has received examples of the normal <i>Amblystoma
  tigrinum</i> from various parts of Mexico, and that Alfred Dugès has
  described an <i>Amblystoma</i> from mountains near Mexico City; at the
  same time he feels very <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>[v.03 p.0070]</span>suspicious of the various
  statements to that effect which have appeared in so many works, and
  rather disposed to make light of the ingenious theories launched by
  biological speculators who have never set foot in Mexico, especially
  Weismann's picture of the dismal condition of the salt-incrusted
  surroundings which were supposed to have hemmed in the axolotl&mdash;the
  brackish Lago de Texcoco, the largest of the lakes near Mexico, being
  evidently in the philosopher's mind.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the enthusiasm of H. Gadow during his visit to Mexico in the
  summer of 1902, we are now better informed on the conditions under which
  the axolotl lives near Mexico City. First, he ascertained that there are
  no axolotls at all in the Lago de Texcoco, thus disposing at once of the
  Weismannian explanation; secondly, he confirmed A. Dugès's statement that
  there is a second species of <i>Amblystoma</i>, which is normal in its
  metamorphosis, near Mexico but at a higher altitude, which may explain
  Velasco's observation that regularly transforming <i>Amblystomas</i>
  occur near that city; and thirdly, he made a careful examination of the
  two lakes, Chalco and Xochimilco, where the axolotls occur in abundance
  and are procured for the market. The following is an abstract of Gadow's
  very interesting account. "Lakes Chalco and Xochimilco are a paradise,
  situated about 10 ft. higher than the Texcoco Lake and separated from it
  by several hills. High mountains slope down to the southern shores, with
  a belt of fertile pastures, with shrubs and trees and little streams,
  here and there with rocks and ravines. In fact, there are thousands of
  inviting opportunities for newts to leave the lake if they wanted to do
  so. Lake Xochimilco contains powerful springs, but away from them the
  water appears dark and muddy, full of suspended fresh and decomposing
  vegetable matter, teeming with fish, larvae of insects, <i>Daphniae</i>,
  worms and axolotl. These breed in the beginning of February. The native
  fishermen know all about them; how the eggs are fastened to the water
  plants, how soon after the little larvae swarm about in thousands, how
  fast they grow, until by the month of June they are all grown into big,
  fat creatures ready for the market; later in the summer the axolotls are
  said to take to the rushes, in the autumn they become scarce, but none
  have ever been known to leave the water or to metamorphose, nor are any
  perfect <i>Amblystomas</i> found in the vicinity of the two lakes."</p>

  <p>In Gadow's opinion, the reason why there are only perennibranchiate
  axolotls in these lakes is obvious. The constant abundance of food,
  stable amount of water, innumerable hiding-places in the mud, under the
  banks, amongst the reeds and roots of the floating islands which are
  scattered all over them,&mdash;all these points are inducements or
  attractions so great that the creatures remain in their paradise and
  consequently retain all those larval features which are not directly
  connected with sexual maturity. There is nothing whatever to prevent them
  from leaving these lakes, but there is also nothing to induce them to do
  so. The same applies occasionally to European larvae, as in the case
  observed in the Italian Alps by F. de Filippi. Nevertheless, in the
  axolotl the latent tendency can still be revived, as we have seen above
  and as is proved by the experiments of Marie von Chauvin. When once
  sexually ripe the axolotl are apparently incapable of changing, but their
  ancestral course of evolution is still latent in them, and will, if
  favoured by circumstances, reappear in following generations.</p>

  <p><b>AXUM,</b> or <span class="sc">Aksum</span>, an ancient city in the
  province of Tigré, Abyssinia (14° 7&prime; 52&Prime; N., 38° 31&prime;
  10&Prime; E.; altitude, 7226 ft), 12 m. W. by S. of Adowa. Many European
  travellers have given descriptions of its monuments, though none of them
  has stayed there more than a few days. The name, written Aksm and Aksum
  in the Sabaean and Ethiopic inscriptions in the place, is found in
  classical and early Christian writers in the forms of Auxome, Axumis,
  Axume, &amp;c., the first mention being in the <i>Periplus Maris
  Erythraei</i> (c. <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 67), where it is said to
  be the seat of a kingdom, and the emporium for the ivory brought from the
  west. For the history of this kingdom see <span
  class="sc">Ethiopia</span>. J.&nbsp;T. Bent conjectured that the seat of
  government was transferred to Axum from Jeha, which he identified with
  the ancient Ava; and according to a document quoted by Achille Raffray
  the third Christian monarch transferred it from Axum to Lalibela. This
  second transference probably took place very much later; in spite of it,
  the custom of crowning Abyssinian kings at Axum continued, and King John
  was crowned there as late as 1871 or 1872. A.&nbsp;B. Wylde conjectures that
  it had become unsuitable for a royal seat by having acquired the status
  of a sacred city, and thus affording sanctuary to criminals and political
  offenders within the chief church and a considerable area round it, where
  there are various houses in which such persons can be lodged and
  entertained. This same sanctity makes it serve as a depository for goods
  of all sorts in times of danger, the chief church forming a sort of bank.
  The present town, containing less than a thousand houses, is supposed to
  occupy only a small portion of the area covered by the ancient city; it
  lies in a kloof or valley, but the old town must have been built on the
  western ridge rather than in the valley, as the traces of well-dressed
  stones are more numerous there than elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Most of the antiquities of Axum still await excavation; those that
  have been described consist mainly of obelisks, of which about fifty are
  still standing, while many more are fallen. They form a consecutive
  series from rude unhewn stones to highly finished obelisks, of which the
  tallest still erect is 60 ft. in height, with 8 ft. 7 in. extreme front
  width; others that are fallen may have been taller. The highly finished
  monoliths are all representations of a many-storeyed castle, with an
  altar at the base of each. They appear to be connected with Semitic
  sun-worship, and are assigned by Bent to the same period as the temple at
  Baalbek, though some antiquarians would place them much earlier; the
  representation of a castle in a single stone seems to bear some relation
  to the idea worked out in the monolith churches of Lalibela described by
  Raffray. The fall of many of the monuments, according to Bent, was caused
  by the washing away of the foundations by the stream called Mai Shum, and
  indeed the native tradition states that "Gudert, queen of the Amhara,"
  when she visited Axum, destroyed the chief obelisk in this way by digging
  a trench from the river to its foundation. Others attribute it to
  religious fanaticism, or to the result of some barbaric invasion, such as
  Axum may have repeatedly endured before it was sacked by Mahommed Gran,
  sultan of Harrar, about 1535.</p>

  <p><b>AY, AYE.</b> The word "aye," meaning <i>always</i> (and pronounced
  as in "day"; connected with Gr. <span title="aei" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&epsilon;&#x1F77;</span>, always, and Lat. <i>aevum</i>, an
  age), is often spelt "ay," and the <i>New English Dictionary</i> prefers
  this. "Aye," meaning Yes (and pronounced almost like the word "eye"),
  though sometimes identified with "yea," is probably the same word
  etymologically, though differentiated by usage; the form "ay" for this is
  also common, but inconvenient; at one time it was spelt simply <i>I</i>
  (<i>e.g.</i> in Michael Drayton's <i>Idea</i>, 57; published in
  1593).</p>

  <p><b>AYACUCHO,</b> a city and department of central Peru, formerly known
  as Guamanga or Huamanga, renamed from the small plain of Ayacucho
  (<i>Quichua</i>, "corner of death"). This lies near the village of
  Quinua, in an elevated valley 11,600 ft. above sea-level, where a
  decisive battle was fought between General Sucré and the Spanish viceroy
  La Serna in 1824, which resulted in the defeat of the latter and the
  independence of Peru. The city of Ayacucho, capital of the department of
  that name <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[v.03 p.0071]</span>and of the province of Guamanga, is
  situated on an elevated plateau, 8911 ft. above sea-level, between the
  western and central Cordilleras, and on the main road between Lima and
  Cuzco, 394 m. from the former by way of Jauja. Pop. (1896) 20,000. It has
  an agreeable, temperate climate, is regularly built, and has considerable
  commercial importance. It is the seat of a bishopric and of a superior
  court of justice. It is distinguished for the number of its churches and
  conventual establishments, although the latter have been closed. The city
  was founded by Pizarro in 1539 and was known as Guamanga down to 1825. It
  has been the scene of many notable events in the history of Peru.</p>

  <p>The department of <span class="sc">Ayacucho</span> extends across the
  great plateau of central Peru, between the departments of Huancavelica
  and Apurimac, with Cuzco on the E. and Ica on the W. Area, 18,185 sq. m.;
  pop. (1896) 302,469. It is divided into six provinces, and covers a
  broken, mountainous region, partially barren in its higher elevations but
  traversed by deep, warm, fertile valleys. It formed a part of the
  original home of the Incas and once sustained a large population. It
  produces Indian corn and other cereals and potatoes in the colder
  regions, and tropical fruits, sweet potatoes and mandioca (<i>Jatropha
  manihot</i>, L.) in the low tropical valleys. It is also an important
  mining region, having a large number of silver mines in operation. Its
  name was changed from Guamanga to Ayacucho by a decree of 1825.</p>

  <p><b>AYAH,</b> a Spanish word (<i>aya</i>) for children's nurse or maid,
  introduced by the Portuguese into India and adopted by the English to
  denote their native nurses.</p>

  <p><b>AYALA, DON PEDRO LOPEZ DE</b> (1332-1407), Spanish statesman,
  historian and poet, was born at Vittoria in 1332. He first came into
  prominence at the court of Peter the Cruel, whose cause he finally
  deserted; he greatly distinguished himself in subsequent campaigns,
  during which he was twice made prisoner, by the Black Prince at Nájera
  (1367) and by the Portuguese at Aljubarrota (1385). A favourite of Henry
  II. and John I. of Castile, he was made grand chancellor of the realm by
  Henry III. in 1398. A brave officer and an able diplomat, Ayala was one
  of the most cultivated Spaniards of his time, at once historian,
  translator and poet. Of his many works the most important are his
  chronicles of the four kings of Castile during whose reigns he lived;
  they give a generally accurate account of scenes and events, most of
  which he had witnessed; he also wrote a long satirical and didactic poem,
  interesting as a picture of his personal experiences and of contemporary
  morality. The first part of his chronicle, covering only the reign of
  Peter the Cruel, was printed at Seville in 1495; the first complete
  edition was printed in 1779-1780 in the collection of <i>Crónicas
  Españolas</i>, under the auspices of the Spanish Royal Academy of
  History. Ayala died at Calahorra in 1407.</p>

  <p><b>AYALA Y HERRERA, ADELARDO LOPEZ DE</b> (1828-1879), Spanish writer
  and politician, was born at Guadalcanal on the 1st of May 1828, and at a
  very early age began writing for the theatre of his native town. The
  titles of these juvenile performances, which were played by amateurs,
  were <i>Salga por donde saliere</i>, <i>Me voy á Sevilla</i> and <i>La
  Corona y el Puñal.</i> As travelling companies never visited Guadalcanal,
  and as ladies took no part in the representations, these three plays were
  written for men only. Ayala persuaded his sister to appear as the heroine
  of his comedy, <i>La primera Dama</i>, and the innovation, if it
  scandalized some of his townsmen, permitted him to develop his talent
  more freely. In his twentieth year he matriculated at the university of
  Seville, but his career as a student was undistinguished. In Seville he
  made acquaintance with Garcia Gutierrez, who is reported to have
  encouraged his dramatic ambitions and to have given him the benefit of
  his own experience as a playwright. Early in 1850 Ayala removed his name
  from the university books, and settled in Madrid with the purpose of
  becoming a professional dramatist. Though he had no friends and no
  influence, he speedily found an opening. A four-act play in verse, <i>Un
  Hombre de Estado</i>, was accepted by the managers of the Teatro Español,
  was given on the 25th of January 1851, and proved a remarkable success.
  Henceforward Ayala's position and popularity were secure. Within a
  twelvemonth he became more widely known by his <i>Castigo y Perdón</i>,
  and by a more humorous effort, <i>Los dos Guzmanes</i>; and shortly
  afterwards he was appointed by the <i>Moderado</i> government to a post
  in the home office, which he lost in 1854 on the accession to power of
  the Liberal party. In 1854 he produced <i>Rioja</i>, perhaps the most
  admired and the most admirable of all his works, and from 1854 to 1856 he
  took an active part in the political campaign carried on in the journal
  <i>El Padre Cobos</i>. A <i>zarzuela</i>, entitled <i>Guerta a
  muerte</i>, for which Emilio Arrieta composed the music, belongs to 1855,
  and to the same collaboration is due <i>El Agente de Matrimonios</i>. At
  about this date Ayala passed over from the Moderates to the Progressives,
  and this political man&oelig;uvre had its effect upon the fate of his
  plays. The performances of <i>Los Comuneros</i> were attended by members
  of the different parties; the utterances of the different characters were
  taken to represent the author's personal opinions, and every speech which
  could be brought into connexion with current politics was applauded by
  one half of the house and derided by the other half. A <i>zarzuela</i>,
  named <i>El Conde de Castralla</i>, was given amid much uproar on the
  20th of February 1856, and, as the piece seemed likely to cause serious
  disorder in the theatre, it was suppressed by the government after the
  third performance. Ayala's rupture with the Moderates was now complete,
  and in 1857, through the interest of O'Donnell, he was elected as Liberal
  deputy for Badajoz. His political changes are difficult to follow, or to
  explain, and they have been unsparingly censured. So far as can be
  judged, Ayala had no strong political views, and drifted with the current
  of the moment. He took part in the revolution of 1868, wrote the
  "Manifesto of Cadiz," took office as colonial minister, favoured the
  candidature of the duc de Montpensier, resigned in 1871, returned to his
  early Conservative principles, and was a member of Alfonso XII.'s first
  cabinet. Meanwhile, however divided in opinion as to his political
  conduct, his countrymen were practically unanimous in admiring his
  dramatic work; and his reputation, if it gained little by <i>El Nuevo Don
  Juan</i>, was greatly increased by <i>El Tanto por Ciento</i> and <i>El
  Tejado de Vidrio</i>. His last play, <i>Consuelo</i>, was given on the
  30th of March 1878. Ayala was nominated to the post of president of
  congress shortly before his death, which occurred unexpectedly on the
  30th of January 1879. The best of his lyrical work, excellent for finish
  and intense sincerity, is his <i>Epístola</i> to Emilio Arrieta, and had
  he chosen to dedicate himself to lyric poetry, he might possibly have
  ranked with the best of Spain's modern singers; as it is, he is a very
  considerable poet who affects the dramatic form. In his later writings he
  deals with modern society, its vices, ideals and perils; yet in many
  essentials he is a manifest disciple of Calderon. He has the familiar
  Calderonian limitations; the substitution of types for characters, of
  eloquence for vital dialogue. Nor can he equal the sublime lyrism of his
  model; but he is little inferior in poetic conception, in dignified
  idealization, and in picturesque imagery. And it may be fairly claimed
  for him that in <i>El Tejado de Vidrio</i> and <i>El Tanto par Ciento</i>
  he displays a very exceptional combination of satiric intention with
  romantic inspiration. By these plays and by <i>Rioja</i> and
  <i>Consuelo</i> he is entitled to be judged. They will at least ensure
  for him an honourable place in the history of the modern Spanish
  theatre.</p>

  <p>A complete edition of his dramatic works, edited by his friend and
  rival Tamayo y Baus, has been published in seven volumes (Madrid,
  1881-1885).</p>

  <p><b>AYE-AYE,</b> a word of uncertain signification (perhaps only an
  exclamation), but universally accepted as the designation of the most
  remarkable and aberrant of all the Malagasy lemurs (see <span
  class="sc">Primates</span>). The aye-aye, <i>Chiromys</i> (or
  <i>Daubentonia</i>) <i>madagascariensis</i>, is an animal with a
  superficial resemblance to a long-haired and dusky-coloured cat with
  unusually large eyes. It has a broad rounded head, short face, large
  naked eyes, large hands, and long thin fingers with pointed claws, of
  which the <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>[v.03 p.0072]</span>third is remarkable for its extreme
  slenderness. The foot resembles that of the other lemurs in its large
  opposable great toe with a flat nail; but all the other toes have pointed
  compressed claws. Tail long and bushy. General colour dark brown, the
  outer fur being long and rather loose, with a woolly under-coat. Teats
  two, inguinal in position. The aye-aye was discovered by Pierre Sonnerat
  in 1780, the specimen brought to Paris by that traveller being the only
  one known until 1860. Since then many others have been obtained, and one
  lived for several years in the gardens of the Zoological Society of
  London. Like so many lemurs, it is completely nocturnal in its habits,
  living either alone or in pairs, chiefly in the bamboo forests.
  Observations upon captive specimens have led to the conclusion that it
  feeds principally on juices, especially of the sugar-cane, which it
  obtains by tearing open the hard woody circumference of the stalk with
  its strong incisor teeth; but it is said also to devour certain species
  of wood-boring caterpillars, which it obtains by first cutting down with
  its teeth upon their burrows, and then picking them out of their retreat
  with the claw of its attenuated middle finger. It constructs large
  ball-like nests of dried leaves, lodged in a fork of the branches of a
  large tree, and with the opening on one side.</p>

  <p>Till recently the aye-aye was regarded as representing a family by
  itself&mdash;the <i>Chiromyidae</i>; but the discovery that it resembles
  the other lemurs of Madagascar in the structure of the inner ear, and
  thus differs from all other members of the group, has led to the
  conclusion that it is best classed as a subfamily (<i>Chiromyinae</i>) of
  the <i>Lemuridae</i>.</p>

  <p><b>AYLESBURY,</b> a market-town in the Aylesbury parliamentary
  division of Buckinghamshire, England, 38 m. N.W. by W. of London; served
  by the Great Central, Metropolitan and Great Western railways (which use
  a common station) and by a branch of the London &amp; North-Western
  railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 9243. It has connexion by a branch
  with the Grand Junction canal. It lies on a slight eminence in a fertile
  tract called the Vale of Aylesbury, which extends northward from the foot
  of the Chiltern Hills. Its streets are mostly narrow and irregular, but
  picturesque. The church of St Mary, a large cruciform building, is
  primarily Early English, but has numerous additions of later dates. The
  font is transitional Norman, a good example; and a small pre-Norman crypt
  remains beneath part of the church. There are some Decorated canopied
  tombs, and the chancel stalls are of the 15th century. The central tower
  is surmounted by an ornate clock-turret dating from the second half of
  the 17th century. The county-hall and town-hall, overlooking a broad
  market-place, are the principal public buildings. The grammar school was
  founded in 1611. Aylesbury is the assize town for the county, though
  Buckingham is the county town. There is a large agricultural trade, the
  locality being especially noted for the rearing of ducks; straw-plaiting
  and the manufacture of condensed milk are carried on, and there are
  printing works. The Jacobean mansion of Hartwell in the neighbourhood of
  Aylesbury was the residence of the French king Louis XVIII. during his
  exile (1810-1814).</p>

  <p>Aylesbury (Æylesburge, Eilesberia, Aillesbir) was famous in Saxon
  times as the supposed burial-place of St Osith. In <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 571 it was one of the towns captured by
  Cuthwulf, brother of Ceawlin, king of the Saxons. At the time of the
  Domesday survey the king owned the manor. In 1554, by a charter from
  Queen Mary, bestowed as a reward for fidelity during the rebellion of the
  duke of Northumberland, Aylesbury was constituted a free borough
  corporate, with a common council consisting of a bailiff, 10 aldermen and
  12 chief burgesses. The borough returned two members to parliament from
  this date until the Redistribution Act of 1885, but the other privileges
  appear to have lapsed in the reign of Elizabeth. Aylesbury evidently had
  a considerable market from very early times, the tolls being assessed at
  the time of Edward the Confessor at £25 and at the time of the Domesday
  survey at £10. In 1239 Henry III. made a grant to John, son of Geoffrey
  FitzPeter of an annual fair at the feast of St Osith (June 3rd), which
  was confirmed by Henry VI. in 1440. Queen Mary's charter instituted a
  Wednesday market and fairs at the feasts of the Annunciation and the
  Invention of the Holy Cross. In 1579 John Pakington obtained a grant of
  two annual fairs to be held on the day before Palm Sunday and on the
  feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross, and a Monday market for the
  sale of horses and other animals, grain and merchandise.</p>

  <p><b>AYLESFORD, HENEAGE FINCH,</b> 1st <span class="sc">Earl of</span>
  (<i>c.</i> 1640-1719), 2nd son of Heneage Finch, 1st earl of Nottingham,
  was educated at Westminster school and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he
  matriculated on the 18th of November 1664. In 1673 he became a barrister
  of the Inner Temple; king's counsel and bencher in 1677; and in 1679,
  during the chancellorship of his father, was appointed solicitor-general,
  being returned to parliament for Oxford University, and in 1685 for
  Guildford. In 1682 he represented the crown in the attack upon the
  corporation of London, and next year in the prosecution of Lord Russell,
  when, according to Burnet, "and in several other trials afterwards, he
  showed more of a vicious eloquence in turning matters with some subtlety
  against the prisoners than of strict or sincere reasoning."<a
  name="FnAnchor_051" href="#Footnote_051"><sup>[1]</sup></a> He does not,
  however, appear to have exceeded the duties of prosecutor for the crown
  as they were then understood. In 1684, in the trial of Algernon Sidney,
  he argued that the unpublished treatise of the accused was an overt act,
  and supported the opinion of Jeffreys that <i>scribere est agere</i>.<a
  name="FnAnchor_052" href="#Footnote_052"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The same year
  he was counsel for James in his successful action against Titus Oates for
  libel, and in 1685 prosecuted Oates for the crown for perjury. Finch,
  however, though a Tory and a crown lawyer, was a staunch churchman, and
  on his refusal in 1686 to defend the royal dispensing power he was
  summarily dismissed by James, He was the leading counsel in June 1688 for
  the seven bishops, when he "strangely exposed and very boldly ran down"<a
  name="FnAnchor_053" href="#Footnote_053"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the
  dispensing power, but his mistaken tactics were nearly the cause of his
  clients losing their case.<a name="FnAnchor_054"
  href="#Footnote_054"><sup>[4]</sup></a> He sat again for Oxford
  University in the convention parliament, which constituency he
  represented in all the following assemblies except that of 1698, till his
  elevation to the peerage. He was, however, no supporter of the House of
  Orange, advocated a regency in James's name, and was one of the few who
  in the House of Commons opposed the famous vote that James had broken the
  contract between king and people and left the throne vacant. He held no
  office during William's reign, and is described by Macky as "always a
  great opposer" of the administration. In 1689 he joined in voting for the
  reversal of Lord Russell's attainder, and endeavoured to defend his
  conduct in the trial, but was refused a hearing by the House. He opposed
  the Triennial Bill of 1692, but in 1696 spoke against the bill of
  association and test, which was voted for the king's protection, on the
  ground that though William was to be obeyed as sovereign he could not be
  acknowledged "rightful and lawful king." In 1694 he argued against the
  crown in the bankers' case. In 1703 he was created baron of Guernsey and
  a privy councillor, and after the accession of George I. on the 19th of
  October 1714, earl of Aylesford, being reappointed a privy councillor and
  made chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, which office he retained till
  February 1716. He died on the 22nd of July 1719. According to John Macky
  (<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 71; published by Roxburghe Club, 1895) he was
  accounted "one of the greatest orators in England and a good common
  lawyer; a firm asserter of the prerogative of the crown and jurisdiction
  of the church; a tall, thin, black man, splenatick." He married
  Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Banks of Aylesford, by
  whom, besides six daughters, he had three sons, of whom the eldest,
  Heneage, succeeded him as 2nd earl of Aylesford. The 2nd earl died in
  1757, and since this date the earldom has been held by his direct
  descendants, six of whom in succession have borne the Christian name of
  Heneage.</p>

  <p>Many of his legal arguments are printed in <i>State Trials</i> (see

  authorship of <i>An Antidote against Poison ... Remarks upon a Paper
  printed by Lady (Rachel) Russel</i> (1683), ascribed in <i>State

  <p><b>AYLESFORD,</b> a town in the Medway parliamentary division of Kent,
  England, 3½ m. N.W. of Maidstone on the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham
  railway. Pop. (1901) 2678. It stands at the base of a hill on the right
  bank of the Medway. The ancient church of St. Peter (restored in 1878) is
  principally Perpendicular, but contains some Norman and Decorated
  portions. It has interesting brasses of the 15th and 16th centuries and
  an early embattled tower. At a short distance west, a residence occupying
  part of the site, are remains of a Carmelite friary, founded here in
  1240. It is claimed for this foundation (but not with certainty) that it
  was the first house of Carmelites established in England, and the first
  general chapter of the order was held here in 1245. Several remains of
  antiquity exist in the neighbourhood, among them a cromlech called Kit's
  Coty House, about a mile north-east from the village. (See <span
  class="sc">Stone Monuments</span>, Plate, fig. 2.) In accordance with
  tradition this has been thought to mark the burial-place of Catigern, who
  was slain here in a battle between the Britons and Saxons in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 455; the name has also been derived from Celtic
  <i>Ked-coit</i>, that is, the tomb in the wood. The name of the larger
  group of monuments close by, called the Countless Stones, is due to the
  popular belief, which occurs elsewhere, that they are not to be counted.
  Large numbers of British coins have been found in the neighbourhood. The
  supposed tomb of Horsa, who fell in the same battle, is situated at
  Horsted, about 2 m. to the north.</p>

  <p><b>AYLLON, LUCAS VASQUEZ DE</b> (<i>c.</i> 1475-1526), Spanish
  adventurer and colonizer in America, was born probably in Toledo, Spain,
  about 1475. He accompanied Nicolas Ovando to Hispaniola (Santo Domingo)
  in 1502, and there became a magistrate of La Concepcion and other towns,
  and a member of the superior court of Hispaniola. He engaged with great
  profit in various commercial enterprises, became interested in a plan for
  the extension of the Spanish settlements to the North American mainland,
  and in 1521 sent Francisco Gordillo on an exploring expedition which
  touched on the coast of the Florida peninsula and coasted for some
  distance northward. Gordillo's report of the region was so favourable
  that Ayllon in 1523 obtained from Charles V. a rather indefinite charter
  giving him the right to plant colonies. He sent another reconnoitring
  expedition in 1525, and early in 1526 he himself set out with 500
  colonists and about 100 African slaves. He touched at several places
  along the coast, at one time stopping long enough to replace a wrecked
  ship with a new one, this being considered the first instance of
  shipbuilding on the North American continent. Sailing northward to about
  latitude 33° 40&prime;, he began the construction of a town which he
  called San Miguel. The exact location of this town is in dispute, some
  writers holding that it was on the exact spot upon which Jamestown, Va.,
  was later built; more probably, however, as Lowery contends, it was near
  the mouth of the Pedee river. The employment of negro slaves here was
  undoubtedly the first instance of the sort in what later became the
  United States. The spot was unhealthy and fever carried off many of the
  colonists, including Ayllon himself, who died on the 18th of October
  1526. After the death of their leader dissensions broke out among the
  colonists, some of the slaves rebelled and escaped into the forest, and
  in December the town was abandoned and the remnant of the colonists
  embarked for Hispaniola, less than 150 arriving in safety.</p>

  <p><b>AYLMER, JOHN</b> (1521-1594), English divine, was born in the year
  1521 at Aylmer Hall, Tivetshall St Mary, Norfolk. While still a boy, his
  precocity was noticed by Henry Grey, marquis of Dorset, afterwards duke
  of Suffolk, who sent him to Cambridge, where he seems to have become a
  fellow of Queens' College. About 1541 he was made chaplain to the duke,
  and tutor to his daughter, Lady Jane Grey. His first preferment was to
  the archdeaconry of Stow, in the diocese of Lincoln, but his opposition
  in convocation to the doctrine of transubstantiation led to his
  deprivation and to his flight into Switzerland. While there he wrote a
  reply to John Knox's famous <i>Blast against the Monstrous Regiment of
  Women</i>, under the title of <i>An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe
  Subjects, &amp;c.</i>, and assisted John Foxe in translating the <i>Acts
  of the Martyrs</i> into Latin. On the accession of Elizabeth he returned
  to England. In 1559 he resumed the Stow archdeaconry, and in 1562 he
  obtained that of Lincoln. He was a member of the famous convocation of
  1562, which reformed and settled the doctrine and discipline of the
  Church of England. In 1576 he was consecrated bishop of London, and while
  in that position made himself notorious by his harsh treatment of all who
  differed from him on ecclesiastical questions, whether Puritan or Papist.
  Various efforts were made to remove him to another see. He is frequently
  assailed in the famous <i>Marprelate Tracts</i>, and is characterized as
  "Morrell," the bad shepherd, in Spenser's <i>Shepheard's Calendar</i>
  (July). His reputation as a scholar hardly balances his inadequacy as a
  bishop in the transition time in which he lived. He died in June 1594.
  His Life was written by John Strype (1701).</p>

  <p><b>AYMARA</b> (anc. <i>Colla</i>), a tribe of South American Indians,
  formerly inhabiting the country around Lake Titicaca and the neighbouring
  valleys of the Andes. They form now the chief ethnical element in
  Bolivia, but are of very mixed blood. In early days the home of the
  Aymaras by Lake Titicaca was a "holy land" for the Incas themselves,
  whose national legends attributed the origin of all Quichua (Inca)
  civilization to that region. The Aymaras, indeed, seem to have possessed
  a very considerable culture before their conquest by the Incas in the
  13th and 14th centuries, evidence of which remains in the megalithic
  ruins of Tiahuanaco. When the Spaniards arrived the Aymaras had been long
  under the Inca domination, and were in a decadent state. They, however,
  retained certain privileges, such as the use of their own language; and
  their treatment by their conquerors generally suggested that the latter
  believed themselves of Aymara blood. Physically, the pure Aymara is short
  and thick-set, with a great chest development, and with the same reddish
  complexion, broad face, black eyes and rounded forehead which distinguish
  the Quichuas. Like the latter, too, the Aymaras are sullen and apathetic
  in disposition. They number now, including half-breeds, about half a
  million in Bolivia. Some few are also found in southern Peru.</p>

  <p><b>AYMER,</b> or <span class="sc">Æthelmar</span>, <b>OF VALENCE</b>
  (d. 1260), bishop of Winchester, was a half-brother of Henry III. His
  mother was Isabelle of Angoulême, the second wife of King John, his
  father was Hugo of Lusignan, the count of La Marche, whom Isabelle
  married in 1220. The children of this marriage came to England in 1247 in
  the hope of obtaining court preferment. In 1250 the king, by putting
  strong pressure upon the electors, succeeded in obtaining the see of
  Winchester for Aymer. The appointment was in every way unsuitable. Aymer
  was illiterate, ignorant of the English language, and wholly secular in
  his mode of life. Upon his head was concentrated the whole of the popular
  indignation against the foreign favourites; and he seems to have deserved
  this unenviable distinction. At the parliament of Oxford (1258) he and
  his brothers repudiated the new constitution prepared by the barons. He
  was pursued to Winchester, besieged in Wolvesey castle, and finally
  compelled to surrender and leave the kingdom. He had never been
  consecrated; accordingly in 1259 the chapter of Winchester proceeded to a
  new election. Aymer, however, gained the support of the pope; he was on
  his way back to England when he was overtaken by a fatal illness at
  Paris.</p>

  <p><b>AYMESTRY LIMESTONE,</b> an inconstant limestone which occurs
  locally in the Ludlow series of Silurian rocks, between the Upper and
  Lower Ludlow shales. It derives its name from Aymestry in Herefordshire,
  where it may be seen on both sides of the river Lugg. It is well
  developed in the neighbourhood of Ludlow (it is sometimes called the
  Ludlow limestone) and occupies a similar position in the Ludlow shales at
  Woolhope, <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>[v.03 p.0074]</span>the Abberley Hills, May Hill and
  the Malvern Hills. In lithological character it varies greatly; in one
  place it is a dark grey, somewhat crystalline limestone, elsewhere it
  passes into a flaggy, earthy or shaly condition, or even into a mere
  layer of nodules. When well developed it may reach 50 ft. in thickness in
  beds of from 1 to 5 ft.; in this condition it naturally forms a
  conspicuous feature in the landscape because it stands out by its
  superior hardness from the soft shales above and below.</p>

  <p>The most common fossil is <i>Pentamerus Knightii</i>, which is
  extremely abundant in places. Other brachiopods, corals and trilobites
  are present, and are similar to those found in the Wenlock limestone.

  <p><b>AYR,</b> a royal, municipal and police burgh and seaport, and
  county town of Ayrshire, Scotland, at the mouth of the river Ayr, 41½ m.
  S.S.W. of Glasgow by the Glasgow &amp; South-Western railway. Pop. (1891)
  24,944; (1901) 29,101. It is situated on a fine bay and its beautiful
  sands attract thousands of summer visitors. Ayr proper lies on the south
  bank of the river, which is crossed by three bridges, besides the railway
  viaduct&mdash;the Victoria Bridge (erected in 1898) and the famous "Twa
  Brigs" of Burns. The Auld Brig is said to date from the reign of
  Alexander III. (d. 1286). The New Brig was built in 1788, mainly owing to
  the efforts of Provost Ballantyne. The prophecy which Burns put into the
  mouth of the venerable structure came true in 1877, when the newer bridge
  yielded to floods and had to be rebuilt (1879); and the older structure
  itself was closed for public safety in 1904. The town has extended
  greatly on the southern side of the stream, where, in the direction of
  the racecourse, there are now numerous fine villas. The county buildings,
  designed after the temple of Isis in Rome, accommodate the circuit and
  provincial courts and various local authorities. The handsome town
  buildings, surmounted by a fine spire 226 ft. high, contain assembly and
  reading rooms. Of the schools the most notable is the Academy (rebuilt in
  1880), which in 1764 superseded the grammar school of the burgh, which
  existed in the 13th century. The Gothic Wallace Tower in High Street
  stands on the site of an old building of the same name taken down in
  1835, from which were transferred the clock and bells of the Dungeon
  steeple. A niche in front is filled by a statue of the Scottish hero by
  James Thorn (1802-1850), a self-taught sculptor. There are statues of
  Burns, the 13th earl of Eglinton, General Smith Neill and Sir William
  Wallace. The Carnegie free library was established in 1893. The
  charitable institutions include the county hospital, district asylum, a
  deaf and dumb home, the Kyle combination poor-house, St John's refuge and
  industrial schools for boys and girls. The <i>Ayr Advertiser</i> first
  appeared on 5th of August 1803, and was the earliest newspaper published
  in Ayrshire. In the suburbs is a racecourse where the Western Meeting is
  held in September of every year. The principal manufactures include
  leather, carpets, woollen goods, flannels, blankets, lace, boots and
  shoes; and fisheries and shipbuilding are also carried on. There are
  several foundries, engineering establishments and saw mills. Large
  quantities of timber are imported from Canada and Norway; coal, iron,
  manufactured goods and agricultural produce are the chief exports. The
  harbour, with wet and slip dock, occupies both sides of the river from
  the New Bridge to the sea, and is protected on the south by a pier
  projecting some distance into the sea, and on the north by a breakwater
  with a commodious dry dock. There are esplanades to the south and north
  of the harbour. The town is governed by a provost and council, and unites
  with Irvine, Inveraray, Campbeltown and Oban in returning one member to
  parliament.</p>

  <p>In 1873 the municipal boundary was extended northwards beyond the
  river so as to include Newton-upon-Ayr and Wallace Town, formerly
  separate. Newton is a burgh or barony of very ancient creation, the
  charter of which is traditionally said to have been granted by Robert
  Bruce in favour of forty-eight of the inhabitants who had distinguished
  themselves at Bannockburn. The suburb is now almost wholly occupied with
  manufactures, the chief of which are chemicals, boots and shoes, carpets
  and lace. It is on the Glasgow &amp; South-Western railway, and has a
  harbour and dock from which coal and goods are the main exports. About 3
  m. north of Ayr is Prestwick, a popular watering-place and the
  headquarters of one of the most flourishing golf clubs in Scotland. The
  outstanding attraction of Ayr, however, is the pleasant suburb of
  Alloway, 2½ m. to the south, with which there is frequent communication
  by electric cars. The "auld clay biggin" in which Robert Burns was born
  on the 25th of January 1759, has been completely repaired and is now the
  property of the Ayr Burns's Monument trustees. In the kitchen is the box
  bed in which the poet was born, and many of the articles of furniture
  belonged to his family. Adjoining the cottage is a museum of Burnsiana.
  The "auld haunted kirk," though roofless, is otherwise in a fair state of
  preservation, despite relic-hunters who have removed all the woodwork. In
  the churchyard is the grave of William Burness, the poet's father. Not
  far distant, on a conspicuous position close by the banks of the Doon,
  stands the Grecian monument to Burns, in the grounds of which is the
  grotto containing Thorn's figures of Tam o' Shanter and Souter
  Johnnie.</p>

  <p>Nothing is known of the history of Ayr till the close of the 12th
  century, when it was made a royal residence, and soon afterwards a royal
  burgh, by William the Lion. During the wars of Scottish independence the
  possession of Ayr and its castle was an object of importance to both the
  contending parties, and the town was the scene of many of Wallace's
  exploits. In 1315 the Scottish parliament met in the church of St John to
  confirm the succession of Edward Bruce to the throne. Early in the 16th
  century it was a place of considerable influence and trade. The
  liberality of William the Lion had bestowed upon the corporation an
  extensive grant of lands; while in addition to the well-endowed church of
  St John, it had two monasteries, each possessed of a fair revenue. When
  Scotland was overrun by Cromwell, Ayr was selected as the site of one of
  the forts which he built to command the country. This fortification,
  termed the citadel, enclosed an area of ten or twelve acres, and included
  within its limits the church of St John, which was converted into a
  storehouse, the Protector partly indemnifying the inhabitants by
  contributing £150 towards the erection of a new place of worship, now
  known as the Old Church. A portion of the tower of St John's church
  remains, but has been completely modernized. The site of the fort is now
  nearly covered with houses, the barracks being in Fort Green.</p>

  <p><b>AYRER, JAKOB</b> (?-1605), German dramatist, of whose life little
  is known. He seems to have come to Nuremberg as a boy and worked his way
  up to the position of imperial notary. He died at Nuremberg on the 26th
  of March 1605. Besides a rhymed <i>Chronik der Stadt Bamberg</i> (edited
  by J. Heller, Bamberg, 1838), and an unpublished translation of the
  Psalms, Ayrer has left a large number of dramas which were printed at
  Nuremberg under the title <i>Opus Theatricum</i> in 1618. This collection
  contains thirty tragedies and comedies and thirty-six
  <i>Fastnachtsspiele</i> (Shrovetide plays) and <i>Singspiele</i>. As a
  dramatist, Ayrer is virtually the successor of Hans Sachs (<i>q.v.</i>),
  but he came under the influence of the so-called <i>Englische
  Komödianten</i>, that is, troupes of English actors, who, at the close of
  the 16th century and during the 17th, repeatedly visited the continent,
  bringing with them the repertory of the Elizabethan theatre. From those
  actors Ayrer learned how to enliven his dramas with sensational incidents
  and spectacular effects, and from them he borrowed the character of the
  clown. His plays, however, are in spite of his foreign models, hardly
  more dramatic, in the true sense of the word, than those of Hans Sachs,
  and they are inferior to the latter in poetic qualities. The plots of two
  of his comedies, <i>Von der schönen Phoenicia</i> and <i>Von der schönen
  Sidea</i>, were evidently drawn from the same sources as those of
  Shakespeare's <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> and <i>Tempest</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ayrers Dramen</i>, edited by A. von Keller, have been published by
  the Stuttgart Lit. Verein (1864-1865). See also L. Tieck, <i>Deutsches
  Theater</i> (1817); A. Cohn, <i>Shakespeare in Germany</i> (1885), which
  contains a translation of the two plays mentioned above; J. Tittmann,
  <i>Schauspiele des sechzehnten Jahrhunderts</i> (1888).</p>

  <p><b>AYRSHIRE,</b> a south-western county of Scotland, bounded N. by
  Renfrewshire, E. by Lanarkshire and Dumfriesshire, S.E. by <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>[v.03
  p.0075]</span>Kirkcudbrightshire, S. by Wigtownshire and W. by the Firth
  of Clyde. It includes off its coast the conspicuous rock of Ailsa Craig,
  10 m. W. of Girvan, Lady Island, 3 m. S.W. of Troon, and Horse Island,
  off Ardrossan. Its area is 724,523 acres or 1142 sq. m., its coast-line
  being 70 m. long. In former times the shire was divided into the
  districts of Cunninghame (N. of the Irvine), Kyle (between the Irvine and
  the Boon), and Carrick (S. of the Doon), and these terms are still
  occasionally used. Kyle was further divided by the Ayr into King's Kyle
  on the north and Kyle Stewart. Robert Bruce was earl of Carrick, a title
  now borne by the prince of Wales. The county is politically divided into
  North and South Ayrshire, the former comprising Cunninghame and the
  latter Kyle and Carrick. The surface is generally undulating with a small
  mountainous tract in the north and a larger one in the south and
  south-east. The principal hills are Black Craig (2298 ft.), 5 m.
  south-east of New Cumnock; Enoch (1865 ft.), 5 m. east of Dalmellington;
  Polmaddie (1750 ft.) 2 m. south-east of Barr; Stake on the confines of
  Ayrshire and Renfrewshire, and Corsancone (1547 ft.), 3 m. north-east of
  New Cumnock. None of the rivers is navigable, but their varied and
  tranquil beauty has made them better known than many more important
  streams. The six most noted are the Stinchar (<i>c</i> soft), Girvan,
  Doon, Ayr, Irvine and Garnock. Of these the Ayr is the longest. It rises
  at Glenbuck, on the border of Lanarkshire, and after a course of some 38
  m. falls into the Firth of Clyde at the county town which, with the
  county, is named from it. The scenery along its banks from Sorn
  downwards&mdash;passing Catrine, Ballochmyle, Barskimming, Sundrum,
  Auchencruive and Craigie&mdash;is remarkably picturesque. The lesser
  streams are numerous, but Burns's verse has given preeminence to the
  Afton, the Cessnock and the Lugar. There are many lochs, the largest of
  which is Loch Doon, 5½ m. long, the source of the river of the same name.
  From Loch Finlas, about 20 m. south-east of Ayr, the town derives its
  water-supply. The Nith rises in Ayrshire and a few miles of its early
  course belong to the county.</p>

  <p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The greater portion of the hilly region in the
  south of the county forms part of the Silurian tableland of the south of
  Scotland. Along its north margin there is a belt of elevated ground
  consisting mainly of Old Red Sandstone strata, while the tract of fertile
  low ground is chiefly occupied by younger Palaeozoic rocks. The Silurian
  belt stretching eastwards from the mouth of Loch Ryan to the Merrick
  range is composed of grits, greywackes and shales with thin leaves of
  black shales, containing graptolites of Upper Llandeilo age which are
  repeated by folding and cover a broad area. Near their northern limit
  Radiolarian cherts, mudstones and lavas of Arenig age rise from
  underneath the former along anticlines striking north-east and
  south-west. In the Ballantrae region there is a remarkable development of
  volcanic rocks&mdash;lavas, tuffs and agglomerates&mdash;of Arenig age,
  their horizon being defined by graptolites occurring in cherty mudstones
  and black shales interleaved in lavas and agglomerates. These volcanic
  materials are pierced by serpentine, gabbro and granite. The serpentine
  forms two belts running inland from near Bennane Head and from Burnfoot,
  being typically developed on Balhamie Hill near Colmonell. Gabbro appears
  on the shore north of Lendalfoot, while on the Byne and Grey Hills south
  of Girvan there are patches of granite and quartz-diorite which seem to
  pass into more basic varieties. These volcanic and plutonic rocks and
  Radiolarian cherts are covered unconformably by conglomerates (Bennan
  Hill near Straiton and Kennedy's Pass) which are associated with
  limestones of Upper Llandeilo age that have been wrought in the Stinchar
  valley and at Craighead. South of the river Girvan there is a sequence
  from Llandeilo&mdash;Caradoc to Llandovery&mdash;Tarannon strata,
  excellent sections of which are seen on the shore north of Kennedy's Pass
  and in Penwhapple Glen near Girvan. Llandovery strata again appear north
  of the Girvan at Dailly, where they form an inlier surrounded by the Old
  Red Sandstone and Carboniferous formations. Representatives of Wenlock
  rocks form a narrow belt near the village of Straiton. Some of the
  Silurian sediments of the Girvan province are highly fossiliferous, but
  the order of succession is determined by the graptolites. Near Muirkirk
  and in the Douglas Water there are inliers of Wenlock, Ludlow and
  Downtonian rocks, coming to the surface along anticlines truncated by
  faults and surrounded by Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous strata. In
  the south-east of the county there is a part of the large granite mass
  that stretches from Loch Doon south to Loch Dee, giving rise to wild
  scenery and bounded by the high ground near the head of the Girvan Water,
  boulders of which have been distributed over a wide area during the
  glacial period. Along the northern margin of the uplands the Lower Old
  Red Sandstone is usually faulted against the Silurian strata, but on
  Hadyard Hill south of the Girvan valley they rest on the folded and
  denuded members of the latter system. The three divisions of this
  formation are well represented. The lower group of conglomerates and
  sandstones are well displayed on Hadyard Hill and on the tract near
  Maybole; the middle volcanic series on the shore south of the Heads of
  Ayr and from the Stinchar valley along the Old Red belt towards
  Dalmellington and New Cumnock; while the upper group, comprising
  conglomerates and sandstones, form a well-marked synclinal ford at
  Corsancone north-east of New Cumnock. The Upper Old Red Sandstone appears
  as a fringe round the south-west margin of the Carboniferous rocks of the
  county, and it rises from beneath them on the shore of the Firth of Clyde
  south of Wemyss Bay. The Carboniferous strata of the central low ground
  form a great basin traversed by faults, all the subdivisions of the
  system being represented save the Millstone Grit. Round the north and
  north-east margin there is a great development of volcanic
  rocks&mdash;lavas, tuffs and agglomerates&mdash;belonging to the
  Calciferous Sandstone series, and passing upwards into the Carboniferous
  Limestone. The lower limestones of the latter division are typically
  represented near Dalry and Beith, where in one instance they reach a
  thickness of over 100 ft. They are followed by the coal-bearing group
  (Edge coals of Midlothian) which have been wrought in the Dalry and Patna
  districts and at Dailly. The position of the Millstone Grit is occupied
  by lavas and tuffs, extending almost continually as a narrow fringe round
  the northern margin of the Coal Measures from Saltcoats by Kilmaurs to
  the Crawfordland Water. The workable coals of the true Coal Measures have
  a wide distribution from Kilwinning by Kilmarnock to Galston and again in
  the districts of Coylton, Dalmellington, Lugar and Cumnock. These members
  are overlaid by a set of upper barren red sandstones, probably the
  equivalents of the red beds of Uddingston, Dalkeith and Wemyss in Fife,
  visible in the ravines of Lugar near Ochiltree and of Ayr at Catrine. In
  various parts of the Ayrshire coalfield the coal-seams are rendered
  useless by intrusive sheets of dolerite as near Kilmarnock and
  Dalmellington. In the central part of the field there is an oval-shaped
  area of red sandstones now grouped with the Trias, extending from near
  Tarbolton to Mauchline, where they are largely worked for building stone.
  They are underlaid by a volcanic series which forms a continuous belt
  between the underlying red sandstones of the Coal Measures and the
  overlying Trias. In the north part of the county, as near Wemyss Bay, the
  strata are traversed by dykes of dolerite and basalt trending in a
  north-west direction and probably of Tertiary age.</p>

  <p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;There has been no lack of agricultural
  enterprise. With a moist climate, and, generally, a rather heavy soil,
  drainage was necessary for the successful growth of green crops. Up to
  about 1840, a green crop in the rotation was seldom seen, except on
  porous river-side land, or on the lighter farms of the lower districts.
  In the early part of the 19th century lime was a powerful auxiliary in
  the inland districts, but with repeated applications it gradually became
  of little avail. Thorough draining gave the next great impetus. Enough
  had been done to test its efficacy before the announcement of Sir Robert
  Peel's drainage loan, after which it was rapidly extended throughout the
  county. Green-crop husbandry, and the liberal use of guano and other
  manures, made a wonderful change in the county, and immensely increased
  the amount of produce. Potatoes are now extensively grown, the
  coast-lands supplying the markets of Scotland and the north of England.
  Of roots, turnips, carrots and mangolds are widely cultivated, heavy
  crops being obtained by early sowing and rich manuring. Oats form the
  bulk of the cereal crop, but wheat and barley are also grown. High
  farming has developed the land enormously. Dairying has received
  particular attention. Dunlop cheese was once a well-known product. Part
  of it was very good; but it was unequal in its general character, and
  unsaleable in English markets. Dissatisfied with the inferior commercial
  value of their cheese in comparison with some English varieties, the
  Ayrshire Agricultural Association brought a Somerset farmer and his wife
  in 1855 to teach the Cheddar method, and their effort was most
  successful. Cheddar cheese of first-rate quality is now made in Ayrshire,
  and the annual cheese show at Kilmarnock is the most important in
  Scotland. The Ayrshire breed of cows are famous for the quantity and
  excellence of their milk. Great numbers of cattle, sheep and pigs are
  raised for the market, and the Ayrshire horse is in high repute.</p>

  <p><i>Other Industries.</i>&mdash;Ayrshire is the principal mining county
  in Scotland and has the second largest coalfield. There is a heavy annual
  output also of iron ore, pig iron and fire-clay. The chief coal districts
  are Ayr, Dalmellington, Patna, Maybole, Drongan, Irvine, Coylton,
  Stevenston, Beith, Kilwinning, <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>[v.03 p.0076]</span>Dalry, Kilbirnie, Dreghorn,
  Kilmarnock, Galston, Hurlford, Muirkirk, Cumnock and New Cumnock.
  Ironstone occurs chiefly at Patna, Coylton, Dalry, Kilbirnie, Dreghorn
  and Cumnock, and there are blast furnaces at most of these towns. A
  valuable whetstone is quarried at Bridge of Stair on the Ayr&mdash;the
  Water-of-Ayr stone. The leading manufactures are important. At Catrine
  are cotton factories and bleachfields, and at Ayr and Kilmarnock
  extensive engineering works, and carpet, blanket and woollens, boot and
  shoe factories. Cotton, woollens, and other fabrics and hosiery are also
  manufactured at Dalry, Kilbirnie, Kilmaurs, Beith and Stewarton. An
  extensive trade in chemicals is carried on at Irvine. Near Stevenston
  works have been erected in the sandhills for the making of dynamite and
  other explosives. There are large lace curtain factories at Galston,
  Newmilns and Darvel, and at Beith cabinet-making is a considerable
  industry. Shipbuilding is conducted at Troon, Ayr, Irvine and Fairlie,
  which is famous for its yachts. The leading ports are Ardrossan, Ayr,
  Girvan, Irvine and Troon. Fishing is carried on in the harbours and
  creeks, which are divided between the fishery districts of Greenock and
  Ballantrae.</p>

  <p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;The Glasgow &amp; South-Western railway
  owns most of the lines within the shire, its system serving all the
  industrial towns, ports and seaside resorts. Its trunk line via Girvan to
  Stranraer commands the shortest sea passage to Belfast and the north of
  Ireland, and its main line via Kilmarnock communicates with Dumfries and
  Carlisle and so with England. The Lanarkshire &amp; Ayrshire branch of
  the Caledonian railway company also serves a part of the county. For
  passenger steamer traffic Ardrossan is the principal port, there being
  services to Arran and Belfast and, during the season, to Douglas in the
  Isle of Man. Millport, on Great Cumbrae, is reached by steamer from
  Fairlie.</p>

  <p><i>Population and Administration</i>.&mdash;The population of Ayrshire
  in 1891 was 226,386, and in 1901, 254,468, or 223 to the sq. m. In 1901
  the number of persons speaking Gaelic only was 17. The chief towns, with
  populations in 1901 are: Ardrossan (6077), Auchinleck (2168), Ayr
  (29,101), Beith (4963), Cumnock (3088), Dalry (5316), Darvel (3070),
  Galston (4876), Girvan (4024), Hurlford (4601), Irvine (9618), Kilbirnie
  (4571), Kilmarnock (35,091), Kilwinning (4440), Largs (3246), Maybole
  (5892), Muirkirk (3892), Newmilns (4467), Saltcoats (8120), Stevenston
  (6554), Stewarton (2858), Troon (4764). The county returns two members to
  parliament, who represent North and South Ayrshire respectively. Ayr (the
  county town) and Irvine are royal burghs and belong to the Ayr group of
  parliamentary burghs, and Kilmarnock is a parliamentary burgh of the
  Kilmarnock group. Under the county council special water districts,
  drainage districts, and lighting and scavenging districts have been
  formed. The county forms a sheriffdom, and there are resident
  sheriffs-substitute at Ayr and Kilmarnock, who sit also at Irvine, Beith,
  Cumnock and Girvan. The shire is under school-board jurisdiction, but
  there are a considerable number of voluntary schools, besides secondary
  schools at Ayr, Irvine, Kilmarnock and Beith, while Kilmarnock Dairy
  School is a part of the West of Scotland Agricultural College established
  in 1899. In addition to grants earned by the schools, the county and
  borough councils expend a good deal of money upon secondary and technical
  education, towards which contributions are also made by the Glasgow and
  West of Scotland Technical College and the Kilmarnock Dairy School. The
  technical classes, subsidized at various local centres, embrace
  instruction in agriculture, mining, engineering, plumbing, gardening, and
  various science and art subjects.</p>

  <p><i>History</i>.&mdash;Traces of Roman occupation are found in
  Ayrshire. At the time of Agricola's campaigns the country was held by the
  Damnonii, and their town of Vandogara has been identified with a site at
  Loudoun Hill near Darvel, where a serious encounter with the Scots took
  place. On the withdrawal of the Romans, Ayrshire formed part of the
  kingdom of Strathclyde and ultimately passed under the sway of the
  Northumbrian kings. Save for occasional intertribal troubles, as that in
  which the Scottish king Alpin was slain at Dalmellington in the 9th
  century, the annals are silent until the battle of Largs in 1263, when
  the pretensions of Haakon of Norway to the sovereignty of the Isles were
  crushed by the Scots under Alexander III. A generation later William
  Wallace conducted a vigorous campaign in the shire. He surprised the
  English garrison at Ardrossan, and burned the barns of Ayr in which the
  forces of Edward I were lodged. Robert Bruce is alleged to have been born
  at Turnberry Castle, some 12 m. S.W. of Ayr. In 1307 he defeated the
  English at Loudoun Hill. Cromwell paid the county a hurried visit, during
  which he demolished the castle of Ardrossan and is said to have utilized
  the stones in rearing a fort at Ayr. Between 1660 and 1688 the sympathies
  of the county were almost wholly with the Covenanters, who suffered one
  of their heaviest reverses at Airds Moss&mdash;a morass between the Ayr
  and Lugar,&mdash;their leader, Richard Cameron, being killed (20th of
  July 1680). The county was dragooned and the Highland host ravaged
  wherever it went. The Hanoverian succession excited no active hostility
  if it evoked no enthusiasm. Antiquarian remains include cairns in
  Galston, Sorn and other localities; a road supposed to be a work of the
  Romans, which extended from Ayr, through Dalrymple and Dalmellington,
  towards the Solway; camps attributed to the Norwegians or Danes on the
  hills of Knockgeorgan and Dundonald; and the castles of Loch Doon,
  Turnberry, Dundonald, Portencross, Ardrossan and Dunure. There are ruins
  of celebrated abbeys at Kilwinning and Crossraguel, and of Alloway's
  haunted church, famous from their associations.</p>

  <p><b>AYRTON, WILLIAM EDWARD</b> (1847-1908), English physicist, was born
  in London on the 14th of September 1847. He was educated at University
  College, London, and in 1868 went out to Bengal in the service of the
  Indian Government Telegraph department. In 1873 he was appointed
  professor of physics and telegraphy at the Imperial College of
  Engineering, Tokio. On his return to London six years later he became
  professor of applied physics at the Finsbury College of the City and
  Guilds of London Technical Institute, and in 1884 he was chosen professor
  of electrical engineering at the Central Technical College, South
  Kensington. He published, both alone and jointly with others, a large
  number of papers on physical, and in particular electrical, subjects, and
  his name was especially associated, together with that of Professor John
  Perry, with the invention of a long series of electrical measuring
  instruments. He died in London on the 8th of November 1908. His wife, Mrs
  Hertha Ayrton, whom he married in 1885, assisted him in his researches,
  and became known for her scientific work on the electric arc and other
  subjects. The Royal Society awarded her one of its Royal medals in
  1906.</p>

  <p><b>AYSCOUGH, SAMUEL</b> (1745-1804), English librarian and
  index-maker, was born at Nottingham in 1745. His father, a printer and
  stationer, having ruined himself by speculation, Samuel Ayscough left
  Nottingham for London, where he obtained an engagement in the cataloguing
  department of the British Museum. In 1782 he published a two-volume
  catalogue of the then undescribed manuscripts in the museum. About 1785
  he was appointed assistant librarian at the museum, and soon afterwards
  took holy orders. In 1786 he published an index to the first seventy
  volumes of the <i>Monthly Review</i>, and in 1796 indexed the remaining
  volumes. Both this index and his catalogue of the undescribed manuscripts
  in the museum were private ventures. His first official work was a third
  share in the British Museum catalogue of 1787, and he subsequently
  catalogued the ancient rolls and charters, 16,000 in all. In 1789 he
  produced the first two volumes of the index to the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i>, and in 1790 the first index-concordance to Shakespeare. He
  was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and has been called <!-- Page
  77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[v.03 p.0077]</span>"The
  Prince of Indexers." He died at the British Museum on the 30th of October
  1804.</p>

  <p><b>AYSCUE</b> (erroneously <span class="sc">Askew</span> or <span
  class="sc">Ayscough</span>), <b>SIR GEORGE</b> (d. 1671), British
  admiral, came of an old Lincolnshire family. Beyond the fact that he was
  knighted by Charles I., nothing is known of his career until in 1646 he
  received a naval command. Through the latter years of the first civil
  war, Ayscue seems to have acted as one of the senior officers of the
  fleet. In 1648, when Sir William Batten went over to Holland with a
  portion of his squadron, Ayscue's influence kept a large part of the
  fleet loyal to the Parliament, and in reward for this service he was
  appointed the following year admiral of the Irish Seas. For his conduct
  at the relief of Dublin he received the thanks of Parliament, and in 1651
  he was employed under Blake in the operations for the reduction of
  Scilly. He was next sent to the West Indies in charge of a squadron
  destined for the Conquest of Barbadoes and the other islands still under
  royalist control. This task successfully accomplished, he returned to
  take part in the first Dutch War. In this he played a prominent part, but
  the indecisive battle off Plymouth (August 16th, 1652) cost him his
  command, though an annuity was assigned him. For some years Sir George
  Ayscue lived in retirement, but the later years of the Commonwealth he
  spent in Sweden, Cromwell having despatched him thither as naval adviser.
  At the Restoration he returned, and became one of the commissioners of
  the navy, but on the outbreak of the second Dutch War in 1664 he once
  more hoisted his flag as rear-admiral of the Blue, and took part in the
  battle of Lowestoft (June 3rd, 1665). In the great Four Days' Battle
  (June 11th-14th, 1666) he served with Monck as admiral of the White. His
  flagship, the "Prince Royal," was taken on the third day, and he himself
  remained a prisoner in Holland till the peace. It seems doubtful whether
  he ever again flew his flag at sea, and the date of his death is supposed
  to be 1671. Lely's portrait of Sir George Ayscue is in the Painted Hall
  at Greenwich.</p>

  <p><b>AYTOUN,</b> or <span class="sc">Ayton</span>, <b>SIR ROBERT</b>
  (1570-1638), Scottish poet, son of Andrew Aytoun of Kinaldie, Fifeshire,
  was born in 1570. He was educated at the university of St Andrews, where
  he was incorporated as a student of St Leonard's College in 1584 and
  graduated M.A. in 1588. He lived for some years in France, and on the
  accession of James VI. to the English throne he wrote in Paris a Latin
  panegyric, which brought him into immediate favour at court. He was
  knighted in 1612. He held various lucrative offices, and was private
  secretary to the queens of James I. and Charles I. He died in London and
  was buried in Westminster Abbey on the 28th of February 1638. His
  reputation with his contemporaries was high, both personally and as a
  writer, though he had no ambition to be known as the latter.</p>

  <p>Aytoun's remains are in Latin and English. In respect of the latter he
  is one of the earliest Scots to use the southern standard as a literary
  medium. The Latin poems include the panegyric already referred to, an
  <i>Epicedium in obitum Thoma Rhodi</i>; <i>Basia, sive Strena ad Jacobum
  Hayum</i>; <i>Lessus in funere Raphaelis Thorei</i>; <i>Carina Caro</i>;
  and minor pieces, occasional and epitaphic. His first English poem was
  <i>Diophantus and Charidora</i> (to which he refers in his Latin
  panegyric to James). He has left a number of pieces on amatory subjects,
  including songs and sonnets.</p>

  <p>Aytoun's Latin poems are printed in <i>Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum</i>
  (Amsterdam, 1637), i. pp. 40-75. His English poems are preserved in a MS.
  in the British Museum (<i>Add. MSS.</i> 10,308), which was prepared by
  his nephew, Sir John Aytoun. Both were collected by Charles Rogers in
  <i>The Poems of Sir Robert Aytoun</i> (London, privately printed, 1871).
  This edition is unsatisfactory, though it is better than the first issue
  by the same editor in 1844. Additional poems are included which cannot be
  ascribed to Aytoun, and which in some cases have been identified as the
  work of others. The poem "I do confess thou'rt smooth and fair" may be
  suspected, and the old version of "Auld Lang Syne" and "Sweet Empress"
  are certainly not Aytoun's. Some of the English poems are printed in
  Watson's <i>Collection</i> (1706-1711) and in the <i>Bannatyne
  Miscellany</i>, i. p. 299 (1827). There is a memoir of Aytoun in Rogers's
  edition, and another by Grosart in the <i>Dict. of Nat. Biog.</i>
  Particulars of his public career will be found in the printed
  <i>Calendars of State Papers</i> and <i>Register of the Privy Council</i>
  of the period.</p>

  <p><b>AYTOUN, WILLIAM EDMONSTOUNE</b> (1813-1865), Scottish poet,
  humorist and miscellaneous writer, was born at Edinburgh on the 21st of
  June 1813. He was the only son of Roger Aytoun, a writer to the signet,
  and the family was of the same stock as Sir Robert Aytoun noticed above.
  From his mother, a woman of marked originality of character and
  considerable culture, he derived his distinctive qualities, his early
  tastes in literature, and his political sympathies, his love for ballad
  poetry, and his admiration for the Stuarts. At the age of eleven he was
  sent to the Edinburgh Academy, passing in due time to the university. In
  1833 he spent a few months in London for the purpose of studying law; but
  in September of that year he went to study German at Aschaffenburg, where
  he remained till April 1834. He then resumed his legal pursuits in his
  father's chambers, was admitted a writer to the signet in 1835, and five
  years later was called to the Scottish bar. But, by his own confession,
  though he "followed the law, he never could overtake it." His first
  publication&mdash;a volume entitled <i>Poland, Homer, and other
  Poems</i>, in which he gave expression to his eager interest in the state
  of Poland&mdash;had appeared in 1832. While in Germany he made a
  translation in blank verse of the first part of <i>Faust</i>; but,
  forestalled by other translations, it was never published. In 1836 he
  made his earliest contributions to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, in
  translations from Uhland; and from 1839 till his death he remained on the
  staff of <i>Blackwood</i>. About 1841 he became acquainted with Mr
  (afterwards Sir) Theodore Martin, and in association with him wrote a
  series of light humorous papers on the tastes and follies of the day, in
  which were interspersed the verses which afterwards became popular as the
  <i>Ban Gaultier Ballads</i> (1855). The work on which his reputation as a
  poet chiefly rests is the <i>Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers</i> (1848;
  29th ed. 1883). In 1845 he was appointed professor of rhetoric and
  <i>belles lettres</i> at Edinburgh University. His lectures were very
  attractive, and the number of students increased correspondingly. His
  services in support of the Tory party, especially during the
  Anti-Corn-Law struggle, received official recognition in his appointment
  (1852) as sheriff of Orkney and Zetland. In 1854 appeared <i>Firmilian, a
  Spasmodic Tragedy</i>, in which he attacked and parodied the writings of
  Philip James Bailey, Sydney Dobell and Alexander Smith; and two years
  later he published his <i>Bothwell, a Poem</i>. Among his other literary
  works are a <i>Collection of the Ballads of Scotland</i> (1858), a
  translation of the <i>Poems and Ballads of Goethe</i>, executed in
  co-operation with his friend Theodore Martin (1858), a small volume on
  the <i>Life and Times of Richard I.</i> (1840), written for the <i>Family
  Library</i>, and a novel entitled <i>Norman Sinclair</i> (1861), many of
  the details in which are taken from incidents in his own experience. In
  1860 Aytoun was elected honorary president of the Associated Societies of
  Edinburgh University. In 1859 he lost his first wife, a daughter of John
  Wilson (Christopher North), to whom he was married in 1849, and this was
  a great blow to him. His mother died in November 1861, and his own health
  began to fail. In December 1863 he married Miss Kinnear. He died at
  Blackhills, near Elgin, on the 4th of August 1865.</p>

  <p><b>AYUB KHAN</b> (1855- ), Afghan prince, son of Shere Ali (formerly
  amir of Afghanistan), and cousin of the amir Abdur Rahman, was born about
  1855. During his father's reign little is recorded of him, but after
  Shere Ali's expulsion from Kabul by the English, and his death in January
  1879, Ayub took possession of Herat, and maintained himself there until
  June 1881, when he invaded Afghanistan with the view of asserting his
  claims to the sovereignty, and in particular of gaining possession of
  Kandahar, still in the occupation of the British. He encountered the
  British force commanded by General Burrows at Maiwand on the 27th of
  July, and was able to gain one of the very few pitched battles that have
  been won by Asiatic leaders over an army under European direction. His
  triumph, however, was short-lived; while he hesitated to assault Kandahar
  he was attacked by Sir Frederick (afterwards Lord) Roberts, at the close
  of the latter's memorable march from Kabul, and utterly discomfited, <!--
  Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[v.03
  p.0078]</span>20th of September 1880. He made his way back to Herat,
  where he remained for some time unmolested. In the summer of 1881 he
  again invaded Afghanistan, and on the anniversary of the battle of
  Maiwand obtained a signal victory over Abdur Rahman's lieutenants, mainly
  through the defection of a Durani regiment. Kandahar fell into his hands,
  but Abdur Rahman now took the field in person, totally defeated Ayub, and
  expelled him from Herat. He took refuge in Persia, and for some time
  lived quietly in receipt of an allowance from the Persian government. In
  1887 internal troubles in Afghanistan tempted him to make another
  endeavour to seize the throne. Defeated and driven into exile, he
  wandered for some time about Persia, and in November gave himself up to
  the British agent at Meshed. He was sent to India to live as a state
  prisoner.</p>

  <p><b>AYUNTAMIENTO,</b> the Spanish name for the district over which a
  town council has administrative authority; it is used also for a town
  council, and for the town-hall. The word is derived from the Latin
  <i>adjungere</i>, and originally meant "meeting." In some parts of Spain
  and in Spanish America the town council was called the <i>cabildo</i> or
  chapter, from the Latin <i>capitulum</i>. The ayuntamiento consisted of
  the official members, and of <i>regidores</i> or <i>regulators</i>, who
  were chosen in varying proportions from the "hidalgos" or nobles
  (<i>hijos de algo</i>, sons of somebody) and the "pecheros," or
  commoners, who paid the <i>pecho</i>, or personal tax; pecho (Lat.
  <i>pectus</i>) is in Spanish the breast, and then by extension the
  person. The regidores of the ayuntamientos, or lay cabildos, were checked
  by the royal judge or <i>corregidor</i>, who was in fact the permanent
  chairman or president. The distinction between hidalgo and pechero has
  been abolished in modern Spain, but the powers and the constitution of
  ayuntamientos have been subject to many modifications.</p>

  <p><b>AYUTHIA,</b> a city of Siam, now known to the Siamese as <i>Krung
  Kao</i> or "the Old Capital," situated in 100° 32&prime; E., 14°
  21&prime; N. Pop. about 10,000. The river Me Nam, broken up into a
  network of creeks, here surrounds a large island upon which stand the
  ruins of the famous city which was for more than four centuries the
  capital of Siam. The bulk of the inhabitants live in the floating houses
  characteristic of lower Siam, using as thoroughfares the creeks to the
  edges of which the houses are moored. The ruins of the old city are of
  great archaeological interest, as are the relics, of which a large
  collection is housed in the local museum. Outside the town is an ancient
  masonry enclosure for the capture of elephants, which is still
  periodically used. Ayuthia is on the northern main line of the state
  railways, 42 m. from Bangkok. Great quantities of paddi are annually sent
  by river and rail to Bangkok, in return for which cloth and other goods
  are imported to supply the wants of the agriculturist peasantry. There is
  no other trade. Ayuthia is the chief town of one of the richest
  agricultural provincial divisions of Siam and is the headquarters of a
  high commissioner. The government offices occupy spacious buildings, once
  a royal summer retreat; the government is that of an ordinary provincial
  division (<i>Monton</i>).</p>

  <p>Historically Ayuthia is the most interesting spot in Siam. Among the
  innumerable ruins may be seen those of palaces, pagodas, churches and
  fortifications, the departed glories of which are recorded in the
  writings of the early European travellers who first brought Siam within
  the knowledge of the West, and laid the foundations of the present
  foreign intercourse and trade. The town was twice destroyed by the
  Burmese, once in 1555 and again in 1767, and from the date of the second
  destruction it ceased to be the capital of the country.</p>

  <p><b>AZAÏS, PIERRE HYACINTHE</b> (1766-1845), French philosopher, was
  born at Sorèze and died at Paris. He spent his early years as a teacher
  and a village organist. At the outbreak of the Revolution he viewed it
  with favour, but was soon disgusted at the violence of its methods. A
  critical pamphlet drew upon him the hatred of the revolutionists, and it
  was not until 1806 that he was able to settle in Paris. In 1809 he
  published his great work, <i>Des Compensations dans les destinées
  humaines</i> (5th ed. 1846), which pleased Napoleon so much that he made
  its author professor at St Cyr. In 1811 he became inspector of the public
  library at Avignon, and from 1812 to 1815 he held the same position at
  Nancy. The Restoration government at first suspected him as a
  Bonapartist, but at length granted him a pension. From that time he
  occupied himself in lecturing and the publication of philosophical works.
  In the <i>Compensations</i> he sought to prove that, on the whole,
  happiness and misery are equally balanced, and therefore that men should
  accept the government which is given them rather than risk the horrors of
  revolution. "Le principe de l'inégalité naturelle et essentielle dans les
  destinées humaines conduit inévitablement au fanatisme révolutionnaire ou
  au fanatisme religieux." The principles of compensation and equilibrium
  are found also in the physical universe, the product of matter and force,
  whose cause is God. Force, naturally expansive and operating on the
  homogeneous atoms which constitute elemental matter, is subject to the
  law of equilibrium, or equivalence of action and reaction. The
  development of phenomena under this law may be divided into three
  stages&mdash;the physical, the physiological, the intellectual and moral.
  The immaterial in man is the expansive force inherent in him. Moral and
  political phenomena are the result of the opposing forces of progress and
  preservation, and their perfection lies in the fulfilment of the law of
  equilibrium or universal harmony. This may be achieved in seven thousand
  years, when man will vanish from the world. In an additional five
  thousand, a similar equilibrium will obtain in the physical sphere, which
  will then itself pass away. In addition to his philosophical work, Azaïs
  studied music under his father, Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs (1743-1796),
  professor of music at Sorèze and Toulouse, and composer of sacred music
  in the style of Gossec. He wrote for the <i>Revue musicale</i> a series
  of articles entitled <i>Acoustique fondamentale</i> (1831), containing an
  ingenious, but now exploded, theory of the vibration of the air. His
  other works are: <i>Système universel</i> (8 vols., 1812); <i>Du Sort de
  l'homme</i> (3 vols., 1820); <i>Cours de philosophie</i> (8 vols., 1824),
  reproduced as <i>Explication universelle</i> (3 vols., 1826-1828);
  <i>Jeunesse, maturité, religion, philosophie</i> (1837), <i>De la
  phrénologie, du magnétisme, et de la folie</i> (1843).</p>

  <p><b>AZALEA,</b> a genus of popular hardy or greenhouse plants,
  belonging to the heath order (Ericaceae), and scarcely separable
  botanically from <i>Rhododendron</i>. The beautiful varieties now in
  cultivation have been bred from a few originals, natives of the hilly
  regions of China and Japan, Asia Minor, and the United States. They are
  perhaps unequalled as indoor decorative plants. They are usually
  increased by grafting the half-ripened shoots on the stronger-growing
  kinds, the shoots of the stock and the grafts being in a similarly
  half-ripened condition, and the plants being placed in a moist heat of
  65°. Large plants of inferior kinds, if healthy, may be grafted all over
  with the choicer sorts, so as to obtain a large specimen in a short time.
  They require a rich and fibrous peat soil, with a mixture of sand to
  prevent its getting water-logged. The best time to pot azaleas is three
  or four weeks after the blooming is over. The soil should be made quite
  solid to prevent its retaining too much water. To produce handsome
  plants, they must while young be stopped as required. Specimens that have
  got leggy may be cut back just before growth commences. The lowest
  temperature for them during the winter is about 35°, and during their
  season of growth from 55° to 65° at night, and 75° by day, the atmosphere
  being at the same time well charged with moisture. They are liable to the
  attacks of thrips and red spider, which do great mischief if not promptly
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>The following are some well-known species:&mdash;<i>A. arborescens</i>
  (Pennsylvania), a deciduous shrub 10-20 ft. high; <i>A. calendulacea</i>
  (Carolina to Pennsylvania), a beautiful deciduous shrub 2-6 ft. high,
  with yellow, red, orange and copper-coloured flowers; <i>A. hispida</i>,
  a North American shrub, 10-15 ft. high, flowers white edged with red;
  <i>A. indica</i> (China), the so-called Indian azalea, a shrub 3-6 ft. or
  more high, the original of numerous single and double varieties, many of
  the more vigorous of which are hardy in southern England and Ireland;
  <i>A. nudiflora</i>, a North American shrub, 3-4 ft. high, which
  hybridizes freely with <i>A. calendulacea</i>, <i>A. pontica</i> and
  others, to produce single and <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>[v.03 p.0079]</span>double forms of a great variety of
  shades; <i>A. pontica</i> (Levant, Caucasus, &amp;c.), 4-6 ft. high, with
  numerous varieties differing in the colour of the flowers and the tint of
  the leaves; <i>A. sinensis</i> (China and Japan), a beautiful shrub, 3-4
  ft. high, with orange-red or yellow bell-shaped flowers, hardy in the
  southern half of England, large numbers of varieties being in cultivation
  under the name of Japanese azaleas.</p>

  <p><b>AZAMGARH,</b> or <span class="sc">Azimgarh</span>, a city and
  district of British India, in the Gorakhpur division of the United
  Provinces. The town is situated on the river Tons, and has a railway
  station. It is said to have been founded about 1665 by a powerful
  landholder named Azim Khan, who owned large estates in this part of the
  country. Pop. (1901) 18,835.</p>

  <p>The area of the district is 2207 sq. m. It is bounded on the N. by the
  river Gogra, separating it from Gorakhpur district; on the E. by Ghazipur
  district and the river Ganges; on the S. by the districts of Jaunpur and
  Ghazipur; and on the W. by Jaunpur and Fyzabad. The portion of the
  district lying along the banks of the Gogra is a low-lying tract, varying
  considerably in width; south of this, however, the ground takes a slight
  rise. The slope of the land is from north-west to south-east, but the
  general drainage is very inadequate. Roughly speaking, the district
  consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into
  beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges
  are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.
  The soil is fertile, and very highly cultivated, bearing magnificent
  crops of rice, sugar-cane and indigo. There are several indigo factories.
  A branch of the Bengal &amp; North-Western railway to Azamgarh town was
  opened in 1898. In 1901 the population was 1,529,785, showing a decrease
  of 11% in the decade. The district was ceded to the Company in 1801 by
  the wazirs of Lucknow. In 1857 it became a centre of mutiny. On the 3rd
  of June 1857 the 17th Regiment of Native Infantry mutinied at Azamgarh,
  murdered some of their officers, and carried off the government treasure
  to Fyzabad. The district became a centre of the fighting between the
  Gurkhas and the rebels, and was not finally cleared until October 1858 by
  Colonel Kelly.</p>

  <p><b><span class="special" title="AZAN">A&#x1E92;&#x100;N</span></b>
  (Arabic for "announcement"), the call or summons to public prayers
  proclaimed by the Muezzin (crier) from the mosque twice daily in all
  Mahommedan countries. In small mosques the Muezzin at <span
  class="special" title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span> stands at the door
  or at the side of the building; in large ones he takes up his position in
  the minaret. The call translated runs: "God is most great!" (four times),
  "I testify there is no God but God!" (twice), "I testify that Mahomet is
  the apostle of God!" (twice), "Come to prayer!" (twice), "Come to
  salvation!" (twice), "God is most great!" (twice), "There is no God but
  God!" To the morning <span class="special"
  title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span> are added the words, "Prayer is
  better than sleep!" (twice). The devout Moslem has to make a set response
  to each phrase of the Muezzin. At first these are mere repetitions of
  <span class="special" title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span>, but to the
  cry "Come to prayer!" the listener must answer, "I have no power nor
  strength but from God the most High and Great." To that of "Come to
  salvation!" the formal response is, "What God willeth will be: what He
  willeth not will not be." The recital of the <span class="special"
  title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span> must be listened to with the utmost
  reverence. The passers in the streets must stand still, all those at work
  must cease from their labours, and those in bed must sit up.</p>

  <p>The Muezzin, who is a paid servant of the mosque, must stand with his
  face towards Mecca and with the points of his forefingers in his ears
  while reciting <span class="special"
  title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span>. He is specially chosen for good
  character, and <span class="special"
  title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span> must not be recited by any one
  unclean, by a drunkard, by the insane, or by a woman. The summons to
  prayers was at first simply "Come to prayer!" Mahomet, anxious to invest
  the call with the dignity of a ceremony, took counsel of his followers.
  Some suggested the Jewish trumpet, others the Christian bell, but
  according to legend the matter was finally settled by a
  dream:&mdash;"While the matter was under discussion, Abdallah, a
  Khazrajite, dreamed that he met a man clad in green raiment, carrying a
  bell. Abdallah sought to buy it, saying that it would do well for
  bringing together the assembly of the faithful. 'I will show thee a
  better way,' replied the stranger; 'let a crier cry aloud "God is most
  great, &amp;c."' On awaking, Abdallah went to Mahomet and told him his
  dream," and <span class="special" title="Azan">A&#x1E93;&#x101;n</span>
  was thereupon instituted.</p>

  <p><b>AZARA, DON JOSE NICHOLAS DE</b> (1731-1804), Spanish diplomatist,
  was born in 1731 at Barbunales, Aragon, and was appointed in 1765 Spanish
  agent and procurator-general, and in 1785 ambassador at Rome. During his
  long residence there he distinguished himself as a collector of Italian
  antiquities and as a patron of art. He was also an able and active
  diplomatist, took a leading share in the difficult and hazardous task of
  the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain, and was instrumental in securing
  the election of Pius VI. He withdrew to Florence when the French took
  possession of Rome in 1798, but acted on behalf of the pope during his
  exile and after his death at Valence in 1799. He was afterwards Spanish
  ambassador in Paris. In that post it was his misfortune to be forced by
  his government to conduct the negotiations which led to the treaty of San
  Ildefonso, by which Spain was wholly subjected to Napoleon. Azara was
  friendly to a French alliance, but his experience showed him that his
  country was being sacrificed to Napoleon. The First Consul liked him
  personally, and found him easy to influence. Azara died, worn out, in
  Paris in 1804. His end was undoubtedly embittered by his discovery of the
  ills which the French alliance must produce for Spain.</p>

  <p>Several sympathetic notices of Azara will be found in Thiers,
  <i>Consulat et Empire</i>. See also <i>Reinado de Carlos IV</i>, by Gen.

  (1804).</p>

  <p>His younger brother, <span class="sc">Don Felix de Azara</span>
  (1746-1811), spent twenty years in South America as a commissioner for
  delimiting the boundary between the Spanish and Portuguese territories.
  He made many observations on the natural history of the country, which,
  together with an account of the discovery and history of Paraguay and Rio
  de la Plata, were incorporated in his principal work, <i>Voyage dans
  l'Amérique méridionale depuis 1781 jusqu'en 1801</i>, published at Paris
  in 1809 in French from his MS. by C.&nbsp;A. Walckenaer.</p>

  <p><b>AZEGLIO, MASSIMO TAPARELLI,</b> <span class="sc">Marquis d'</span>
  (1798-1866), Italian statesman and author, was born at Turin in October
  1798, descended from an ancient and noble Piedmontese family. His father,
  Cesare d'Azeglio, was an officer in the Piedmontese army and held a high
  position at court; on the return of Pope <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[v.03 p.0080]</span>Pius VII. to
  Rome after the fall of Napoleon, Cesare d'Azeglio was sent as special
  envoy to the Vatican, and he took his son, then sixteen years of age,
  with him as an extra attaché. Young Massimo was given a commission in a
  cavalry regiment, which he soon relinquished on account of his health.
  During his residence in Rome he had acquired a love for art and music,
  and he now determined to become a painter, to the horror of his family,
  who belonged to the stiff and narrow Piedmontese aristocracy. His father
  reluctantly consented, and Massimo settled in Rome, devoting himself to
  art. He led an abstemious life, maintaining himself by his painting for
  several years. But he was constantly meditating on the political state of
  Italy. In 1830 he returned to Turin, and after his father's death in 1831
  removed to Milan. There he remained for twelve years, moving in the
  literary and artistic circles of the city. He became the intimate of
  Alessandro Manzoni the novelist, whose daughter he married; thenceforth
  literature became his chief occupation instead of art, and he produced
  two historical novels, <i>Niccolò dei Lapi</i> and <i>Ettore
  Fieramosca</i>, in imitation of Manzoni, and with pronounced political
  tendencies, his object being to point out the evils of foreign domination
  in Italy and to reawaken national feeling. In 1845 he visited Romagna as
  an unauthorized political envoy, to report on its conditions and the
  troubles which he foresaw would break out on the death of Pope Gregory
  XVI. The following year he published his famous pamphlet <i>Degli ultimi
  casi di Romagna</i> at Florence, in consequence of which he was expelled
  from Tuscany. He spent the next few months in Rome, sharing the general
  enthusiasm over the supposed liberalism of the new pope, Pius IX.; like
  V. Gioberti and Balbo he believed in an Italian confederation under papal
  auspices, and was opposed to the Radical wing of the Liberal party. His
  political activity increased, and he wrote various other pamphlets, among
  which was <i>I lutti di Lombardia</i> (1848).</p>

  <p>On the outbreak of the first war of independence, d'Azeglio donned the
  papal uniform and took part under General Durando in the defence of
  Vicenza, where he was severely wounded. He retired to Florence to
  recover, but as he opposed the democrats who ruled in Tuscany, he was
  expelled from that country for the second time. He was now a famous man,
  and early in 1849 Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, invited him to form a
  cabinet. But realizing how impossible it was to renew the campaign, and
  "not having the heart to sign, in such wretched internal and external
  conditions, a treaty of peace with Austria" (<i>Correspondance
  politique</i>, by E. Rendu), he refused. After the defeat of Novara (23rd
  of March 1849), Charles Albert abdicated and was succeeded by Victor
  Emmanuel II. D'Azeglio was again called on to form a cabinet, and this
  time, although the situation was even more difficult, he accepted,
  concluded a treaty of peace, dissolved the Chamber, and summoned a new
  one to ratify it. The treaty was accepted, and d'Azeglio continued in
  office for the next three years. While all the rest of Italy was a prey
  to despotism, in Piedmont the king maintained the constitution intact in
  the face of the general wave of reaction. D'Azeglio conducted the affairs
  of the country with tact and ability, improving its diplomatic relations,
  and opposing the claims of the Roman Curia. He invited Count Cavour, then
  a rising young politician, to enter the ministry in 1850. Cavour and
  Farini, also a member of the cabinet, made certain declarations in the
  Chamber (May 1852) which led the ministry in the direction of an alliance
  with Rattazzi and the Left. Of this d'Azeglio disapproved, and therefore
  resigned office, but on the king's request he formed a new ministry,
  excluding both Cavour and Farini. In October, however, owing to
  ill-health and dissatisfaction with some of his colleagues, as well as
  for other reasons not quite clear, he resigned once more and retired into
  private life, suggesting Cavour to the king as his successor.</p>

  <p>For the next four years he lived modestly at Turin, devoting himself
  once more to art, although he also continued to take an active interest
  in politics, Cavour always consulting him on matters of moment. In 1855
  he was appointed director of the Turin art gallery. In 1859 he was given
  various political missions, including one to Paris and London to prepare
  the basis for a general congress of the powers on the Italian question.
  When war between Piedmont and Austria appeared inevitable he returned to
  Italy, and was sent as royal commissioner by Cavour to Romagna, whence
  the papal troops had been expelled. After the peace of Villafranca,
  d'Azeglio was recalled with orders to withdraw the Piedmontese garrisons;
  but he saw the danger of allowing the papal troops to reoccupy the
  province, and after a severe inner struggle left Bologna without the
  troops, and interviewed the king. The latter approved of his action, and
  said that his orders had not been accurately expressed; thus Romagna was
  saved. That same year he published a pamphlet in French entitled <i>De la
  Politique et du droit chrétien au point de vue de la question
  italienne</i>, with the object of inducing Napoleon III. to continue his
  pro-Italian policy. Early in 1860 Cavour appointed him governor of Milan,
  evacuated by the Austrians after the battle of Magenta, a position which
  he held with great ability. But, disapproving of the government's policy
  with regard to Garibaldi's Sicilian expedition and the occupation by
  Piedmont of the kingdom of Naples as inopportune, he resigned office.</p>

  <p>The death of his two brothers in 1862 and of Cavour in 1861 caused
  Massimo great grief, and he subsequently led a comparatively retired
  life. But he took part in politics, both as a deputy and a writer, his
  two chief subjects of interest being the Roman question and the relations
  of Piedmont (now the kingdom of Italy) with Mazzini and the other
  revolutionists. In his opinion Italy must be unified by means of the
  Franco-Piedmontese army alone, all connexion with the conspirators being
  eschewed, while the pope should enjoy nominal sovereignty over Rome, with
  full spiritual independence, the capital of Italy being established
  elsewhere, but the Romans being Italian citizens (see his letters to E.
  Rendu and his pamphlet <i>Le questioni urgenti</i>). He strongly
  disapproved of the convention of 1864 between the Italian government and
  the pope. The last few years of d'Azeglio's life were spent chiefly at
  his villa of Cannero, where he set to work to write his own memoirs. He
  died of fever on the 15th of January 1866.</p>

  <p>Massimo d'Azeglio was a very attractive personality, as well as an
  absolutely honest patriot, and a characteristic example of the best type
  of Piedmontese aristocrat. He was cautious and conservative; in his
  general ideas on the liberation of Italy he was wrong, and to some extent
  he was an amateur in politics, but of his sincerity there is no doubt. As
  an author his political writings are trenchant and clear, but his novels
  are somewhat heavy and old-fashioned, and are interesting only if one
  reads the political allusions between the lines.</p>

  <p>Besides a variety of newspaper articles and pamphlets, d'Azeglio's
  chief works are the two novels <i>Ettore Fieramosca</i> (1833) and
  <i>Niccolò dei Lapi</i> (1841), and a volume of autobiographical memoirs
  entitled <i>I Miei Ricordi</i>, a most charming work published after his
  death, in 1866, but unfortunately incomplete. See in addition to the
  <i>Ricordi</i>, L. Carpi's <i>Il Risorgimento Italiano</i>, vol. i. pp.
  288 sq. and the <i>Souvenirs historiques</i> of Constance d'Azeglio,
  Massimo's niece (Turin, 1884).</p>

  <p><b>AZERB&#x100;ÏJ&#x100;N</b> (also spelt <span
  class="sc">Aderbijan</span>; the <i>Azerb&#x101;deg&#x101;n</i> of
  medieval writers, the <i>Athropatakan</i> and <i>Atropatene</i> of the
  ancients), the north-western and most important province of Persia. It is
  separated from Russian territory on the N. by the river Aras (Araxes),
  while it has the Caspian Sea, Gilan and Khamseh (Zenj&#x101;n) on the E.,
  Kurdistan on the S., and Asiatic Turkey on the W. Its area is estimated
  at 32,000 sq. m.; its population at 1½ to 2 millions, comprising various
  races, as Persians proper, Turks, Kurds, Syrians, Armenians, &amp;c. The
  country is superior in fertility to most provinces of Persia, and
  consists of a regular succession of undulating eminences, partially
  cultivated and opening into extensive plains. Near the centre of the
  province the mountains of Sahand rise in an accumulated mass to the
  height of 12,000 ft. above the sea. The highest mountain of the province
  is in its eastern part, Mount Savelan, with an elevation of 15,792 ft.,
  and the Talish Mountains, which run from north to south, parallel to and
  at no great distance from the Caspian, have an altitude of 9000 ft. The
  principal rivers are the Aras and Kizil Uzain, both receiving numerous
  tributaries and flowing into the Caspian, and the Jaghatu, Tatava, Murdi,
  Aji and others, which <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>[v.03 p.0081]</span>drain into the Urmia lake. The
  country to the west of the lake, with the districts of Selmas and Urmia,
  is the most prosperous part of Azerb&#x101;ïj&#x101;n, yet even here the
  intelligent traveller laments the want of enterprise among the
  inhabitants. Azerb&#x101;ïj&#x101;n is one of the most productive
  provinces of Persia. The orchards and gardens in which many villages are
  embosomed yield delicious fruits of almost every description, and great
  quantities, dried, are exported, principally to Russia. Provisions are
  cheap and abundant, but there is a lack of forests and timber trees.
  Lead, copper, sulphur, orpiment, also lignite, have been found within the
  confines of the province; also a kind of beautiful, variegated,
  translucent marble, which takes a high polish, is used in the
  construction of palatial buildings, tanks, baths, &amp;c., and is known
  as Maragha, or Tabriz marble. The climate is healthy, not hot in summer,
  and cold in winter. The cold sometimes is severely felt by the poor
  classes owing to want of proper fuel, for which a great part of the
  population has no substitute except dried cow-dung. Snow lies on the
  mountains for about eight months in the year, and water is everywhere
  abundant. The best soils when abundantly irrigated yield from 50- to
  60-fold, and the water for this purpose is supplied by the innumerable
  streams which intersect the province. The natives of
  Azerb&#x101;ïj&#x101;n make excellent soldiers, and about a third of the
  Persian army is composed of them. The province is divided into a number
  of administrative sub-provinces or districts, each with a
  <i>h&#x101;kim</i>, governor or sub-governor, under the governor-general,
  who under the Kajar dynasty has always been the heir-apparent to the
  throne of Persia, assisted by a responsible minister appointed by the
  shah. The administrative divisions are as follows:&mdash;Tabriz and
  environs; Uskuh; Deh-Kharegan; Maragha; Miandoab; Sa&#x16B;jbulagh;
  Sulduz; Urmia; Selmas; Khoi; Maku; Gerger; Merend; Karadagh; Arvanek;
  Talish; Ardebil; Mishkin; Khalkh&#x101;l; Hashtrud; Garmrud; Afshar; Sain
  Kaleh; Ujan; Sarab. The revenue amounts to about £200,000 per annum in
  cash and kind, and nearly all of it is expended in the province for the
  maintenance of the court of the heir-apparent, the salaries and pay to
  government officials, troops, pensions, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>AZIMUTH</b> (from the Arabic), in astronomy, the angular distance
  from the north or south point of the horizon to the foot of the vertical
  circle through a heavenly body. In the case of a horizontal line the
  azimuth is its deviation from the north or south direction.</p>

  <p><b>AZO</b> (<i>c.</i> 1150-1230), Italian jurist. This Azo, whose name
  is sometimes written Azzo and Azzolenus, and who is occasionally
  described as Azo Soldanus, from the surname of his father, is to be
  distinguished from two other famous Italians of the same name, viz. Azo
  Lambertaccius, a canonist of the 13th century, professor of canon law at
  the university of Bologna, author of <i>Questiones in jus canonicum</i>,
  and Azo de Ramenghis, a canonist of the 14th century, also a professor of
  canon law at Bologna, and author of <i>Repetitiones super libro
  Decretorum</i>. Few particulars are known as to the life of Azo, further
  than that he was born at Bologna about the middle of the 12th century,
  and was a pupil of Joannes Bassianus, and afterwards became professor of
  civil law in the university of his native town. He also took an active
  part in municipal life, Bologna, with the other Lombard republics, having
  gained its municipal independence. Azo occupied a very important position
  amongst the glossators, and his <i>Readings on the Code</i>, which were
  collected by his pupil, Alessandro de Santo Aegidio, and completed by the
  additions of Hugolinus and Odofredus, form a methodical exposition of
  Roman law, and were of such weight before the tribunals that it used to
  be said, "Chi non ha Azzo, non vada a palazzo." Azo gained a great
  reputation as a professor, and numbered amongst his pupils Accursius and
  Jacobus Balduinus. He died about 1230.</p>

  <p><b>AZO COMPOUNDS,</b> organic substances of the type R·N:N·R&prime;
  (where R = an aryl radical and R&prime; = a substituted alkyl, or aryl
  radical). They may be prepared by the reduction of nitro compounds in
  alkaline solution (using zinc dust and alkali, or a solution of an
  alkaline stannite as a reducing agent); by oxidation of hydrazo
  compounds; or by the coupling of a diazotized amine and any compound of a
  phenolic or aminic type, provided that there is a free para position in
  the amine or phenol. They may also be obtained by the molecular
  rearrangement of the diazoamines, when these are warmed with the parent
  base and its hydrochloride. This latter method of formation has been
  studied by H. Goldschmidt and R.&nbsp;U. Reinders (<i>Ber</i>., 1896, 29, p.
  1369), who found that the reaction is monomolecular, and that the
  velocity constant of the reaction is proportional to the amount of the
  hydrochloride of the base present and also to the temperature, but is
  independent of the concentration of the diazoamine. The azo compounds are
  intensely coloured, but are not capable of being used as dyestuffs unless
  they contain salt-forming, acid or basic groups (see <span
  class="sc">Dyeing</span>). By oxidizing agents they are converted into
  azoxy compounds, and by reducing agents into hydrazo compounds or
  amines.</p>

  <p><i>Azo-benzene</i>,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N:NC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, discovered by E.
  Mitscherlich in 1834, may be prepared by reducing nitrobenzene in
  alcoholic solution with zinc dust and caustic soda; by the condensation
  of nitrosobenzene with aniline in hot glacial acetic acid solution; or by
  the oxidation of aniline with sodium hypobromite. It crystallizes from
  alcohol in orange red plates which melt at 68° C. and boil at 293° C. It
  does not react with acids or alkalis, but on reduction with zinc dust in
  acetic acid solution yields aniline.</p>

  <p><i>Amino-azo Compounds</i> may be prepared as shown above. They are
  usually yellowish brown or red in colour, the presence of more amino
  groups leading to browner shades, whilst the introduction of alkylated
  amino groups gives redder shades. They usually crystallize well and are
  readily reduced. When heated with aniline and aniline hydrochloride they
  yield indulines (<i>q.v.</i>). Amino-azo-benzene,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>,
  crystallizes in yellow plates or needles and melts at 126° C. Its
  constitution is determined by the facts that it may be prepared by
  reducing nitro-azo-benzene by ammonium sulphide and that by reduction
  with stannous chloride it yields aniline and meta-phenylene diamine.
  Diamino-azo-benzene (chrysoidine),
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
  first prepared by O. Witt (<i>Ber.</i>, 1877, 10, p. 656), is obtained by
  coupling phenyl diazonium chloride with meta-phenylene diamine. It
  crystallizes in red octahedra and dyes silk and wool yellow.
  Triamino-azo-benzene (meta-aminobenzene-azo-meta-phenylene diamine or
  Bismarck brown, phenylene brown, vesuvine, Manchester brown),
  NH<sub>2</sub>·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
  is prepared by the action of nitrous acid on meta-phenylene diamine. It
  forms brown crystals which are readily soluble in hot water, and it dyes
  mordanted cotton a dark brown. On the composition of the commercial
  Bismarck brown see E. Tauber and F. Walder (<i>Ber</i>., 1897, 30, pp.
  2111, 2899; 1900, 33, p. 2116). Alkylated amino-azo-benzenes are also
  known, and are formed by the coupling of diazonium salts with alkylated
  amines, provided they contain a free para position with respect to the
  amino group. In these cases it has been shown by H. Goldschmidt and A.
  Merz (<i>Ber</i>., 1897, 30, p. 670) that the velocity of formation of
  the amino-azo compound depends only on the nature of the reagents and not
  on the concentration, and that in coupling the hydrochloride of a
  tertiary amine with diazobenzene sulphonic acid the reaction takes place
  between the acid and the base set free by the hydrolytic dissociation of
  its salt, for the formation of the amino-azo compound, when carried out
  in the presence of different acids, takes place most rapidly with the
  weakest acid (H. Goldschmidt and F. Buss, <i>Ber</i>., 1897, 30, p.
  2075).</p>

  <p><i>Methyl orange</i> (helianthin, gold orange, Mandarin orange),
  (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Na,
  is the sodium salt of para-dimethylaminobenzene-azo-benzene sulphonic
  acid. It is an orange crystalline powder which is soluble in water,
  forming a yellow solution. The free acid is intensely red in colour.
  Methyl orange is used largely as an indicator. The constitution of methyl
  orange follows from the fact that on reduction by stannous chloride in
  hydrochloric acid solution it yields sulphanilic acid and
  para-aminodimethyl aniline.</p>

  <p><i>Oxyazo Compounds</i>.&mdash;The oxyazo compounds are prepared by
  adding a solution of a diazonium salt to a cold slightly alkaline
  solution of a phenol. The diazo group takes up the para position <!--
  Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[v.03
  p.0082]</span>with regard to the hydroxyl group, and if this be prevented
  it then goes into the ortho position. It never goes directly into the
  meta position.</p>

  <p>The constitution of the oxyazo compounds has attracted much attention,
  some chemists holding that they are true azophenols of the type
  R·N<sub>2</sub>·R<sub>1</sub>·OH, while others look upon them as having a
  quinonoid structure, <i>i.e.</i> as being quinone hydrazones, type
  R·NH·N:R<sub>1</sub>:O. The first to attack the purely chemical side were
  Th. Zincke (<i>Ber.</i>, 1883,16, p. 2929; 1884, 17, p. 3026; 1887, 20,
  p. 3171) and R. Meldola (<i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1889, 55, pp. 114,
  603). Th. Zincke found that the products obtained by coupling a diazonium
  salt with <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthol, and by condensing
  phenyl-hydrazine with <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthoquinone,
  were identical; whilst Meldola acetylated the azophenols, and split the
  acetyl products by reduction in acid solution, but obtained no
  satisfactory results. K. Auwers (<i>Zeit. f. phys. Chem.</i>, 1896, 21,
  p. 355; <i>Ber.</i>, 1900, 33, p. 1302) examined the question from the
  physico-chemical standpoint by determining the freezing-point
  depressions, the result being that the para-oxyazo compounds give
  abnormal depressions and the ortho-oxyazo compounds give normal
  depressions; Auwers then concluded that the para compounds are phenolic
  and the ortho compounds are quinone hydrazones or act as such. A.
  Hantzsch (<i>Ber.</i>, 1899, 32, pp. 590, 3089) considers that the oxyazo
  compounds are to be classed as pseudo-acids, possessing in the free
  condition the configuration of quinone hydrazones, their salts, however,
  being of the normal phenolic type. J.&nbsp;T. Hewitt (<i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>,
  1900, 77, pp. 99 et seq.) nitrated para-oxyazobenzene with dilute nitric
  acid and found that it gave a benzene azo-ortho-nitrophenol, whereas
  quinones are not attacked by dilute nitric acid. Hewitt has also attacked
  the problem by brominating the oxyazobenzenes, and has shown that when
  the hydrobromic acid produced in the reaction is allowed to remain in the
  system, a brombenzene-azo-phenol is formed, whilst if it be removed (by
  the addition of sodium acetate) bromination takes place in the phenolic
  nucleus; consequently the presence of the mineral acid gives the azo
  compound a pseudo-quinonoid character, which it does not possess if the
  mineral acid be removed from the sphere of the reaction.</p>

  <p>Para-oxyazobenzene (benzene-azo-phenol),
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N:N(1)·C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·OH(4), is
  prepared by coupling diazotized aniline with phenol in alkaline solution.
  It is an orange-red crystalline compound which melts at 154° C.
  Ortho-oxyazobenzene,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N:N(1)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·OH(2), was
  obtained in small quantity by E. Bamberger (<i>Ber.</i>, 1900, 33, p.
  3189) simultaneously with the para compound, from which it may be
  separated by distillation in a current of steam, the ortho compound
  passing over with the steam. It crystallizes in orange-red needles which
  melt at 82.5-83° C. On reduction with zinc dust in dilute sal-ammoniac
  solution, it yields ortho-aminophenol and aniline. Meta-oxyazobenzene,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N:N(1)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·OH(3), was
  obtained in 1903 by P. Jacobson (<i>Ber.</i>, 1903, 36, p. 4093) by
  condensing ortho-anisidine with diazo benzene, the resulting compound
  being then diazotized and reduced by alcohol to benzene-azo-meta-anisole,
  from which meta-oxyazobenzene was obtained by hydrolysis with aluminium
  chloride. It melts at 112-114° C. and is easily reduced to the
  corresponding hydrazo compound.</p>

  <p><i>Diazo-Amines.</i>&mdash;The diazo-amines, R·N:N·NHR<sub>1</sub>,
  are obtained by the action of primary amines on diazonium salts; by the
  action of nitrous acid on a free primary amine, an iso-diazohydroxide
  being formed as an intermediate product which then condenses with the
  amine; and by the action of nitrosamines on primary amines. They are
  crystalline solids, usually of a yellow colour, which do not unite with
  acids; they are readily converted into amino-azo compounds (see above)
  and are decomposed by the concentrated halogen acids, yielding haloid
  benzenes, nitrogen and an amine. Acid anhydrides replace the
  imino-hydrogen atom by acidyl radicals, and boiling with water converts
  them into phenols. They combine with phenyl isocyanate to form urea
  derivatives (H. Goldschmidt, <i>Ber.</i>, 1888, 21, p. 2578), and on
  reduction with zinc dust (preferably in alcoholic acetic acid solution)
  they yield usually a hydrazine and an amine. Diazoamino benzene,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N:N·NHC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, was first
  obtained by P. Griess (<i>Ann.</i>, 1862, 121, p. 258). It crystallizes
  in yellow laminae, which melt at 96° C. and explode at slightly higher
  temperatures. It is readily soluble in alcohol, ether and benzene.</p>

  <p><i>Diazoimino benzene</i>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, is
  also known. It may be prepared by the action of ammonia on diazobenzene
  perbromide; by the action of hydroxylamine on a diazonium sulphate (K.
  Heumann and L. Oeconomides, <i>Ber.</i>, 1887, 20, p. 372); and by the
  action of phenylhydrazine on a diazonium sulphate. It is a yellow oil
  which boils at 59° C. (12 mm.), and possesses a stupefying odour. It
  explodes when heated. Hydrochloric acid converts it into chloraniline,
  nitrogen being eliminated; whilst boiling sulphuric acid converts it into
  aminophenol.</p>

  <p><i>Azoxy Compounds</i>, R·<span class="over">N·O·N</span>·R&prime;,
  are usually yellow or red crystalline solids which result from the
  reduction of nitro or nitroso compounds by heating them with alcoholic
  potash (preferably using methyl alcohol). They may also be obtained by
  the oxidation of azo compounds. When reduced (in acid solution) they
  yield amines; distillation with reduced iron gives azo compounds, and
  warming with ammonium sulphide gives hydrazo compounds. Concentrated
  sulphuric acid converts azoxybenzene into oxyazobenzene (O. Wallach,
  <i>Ber.</i>, 1880, 13, p. 525). Azoxybenzene,
  (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>O, crystallizes from alcohol in
  yellow needles, which melt at 36° C. On distillation, it yields aniline
  and azobenzene. Azoxybenzene is also found among the electro-reduction
  products of nitrobenzene, when the reduction is carried out in
  alcoholic-alkaline solution.</p>

  <p>The mixed azo compounds are those in which the azo group ·N:N· is
  united with an aromatic radical on the one hand, and with a radical of
  the aliphatic series on the other. The most easily obtained mixed azo
  compounds are those formed by the union of a diazonium salt with the
  potassium or sodium salt of a nitroparaffin (V. Meyer, <i>Ber.</i>, 1876,
  9, p. 384):</p>

  <p>Those not containing a nitro group may be prepared by the oxidation of
  the corresponding mixed hydrazo compounds with mercuric oxide. E.
  Bamberger (<i>Ber.</i>, 1898, 31, p. 455) has shown that the nitro-alkyl
  derivatives behave as though they possess the constitution of hydrazones,
  for on heating with dilute alkalies they split more or less readily into
  an alkaline nitrite and an acid hydrazide:</p>

  <p>Benzene-azo-methane,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·CH<sub>3</sub>, is a yellow oil
  which boils at 150° C. and is readily volatile in steam.
  Benzene-azo-ethane,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, is a
  yellow oil which boils at about 180° C. with more or less decomposition.
  On standing with 60% sulphuric acid for some time, it is converted into
  the isomeric acetaldehyde-phenylhydrazone,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH·N:CH·CH<sub>3</sub> (<i>Ber.</i>, 1896, 29,
  p. 794).</p>

  <p>The diazo cyanides, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>·CN, and
  carboxylic acids, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·COOH, may also
  be considered as mixed azo derivatives. Diazobenzenecyanide,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>·CN, is an unstable oil, formed
  when potassium cyanide is added to a solution of a diazonium salt.
  Phenyl-azo-carboxylic acid,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·COOH, is obtained in the form of
  its potassium salt when phenylsemicarbazide is oxidized with potassium
  permanganate in alkaline solution (J. Thiele, <i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, p.
  2600). It crystallizes in orange-red needles and is decomposed by water.
  The corresponding amide, phenyl-azo-carbonamide,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>·CONH<sub>2</sub>, also results
  from the oxidation of phenylsemicarbazide (Thiele, <i>loc. cit.</i>), and
  forms reddish-yellow needles which melt at 114° C. When heated with
  benzaldehyde to 120° C. it yields diphenyloxytriazole,
  (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>3</sub>C(OH).</p>

  <p><b>AZOIMIDE,</b> or <span class="sc">Hydrazoic Acid</span>,
  N<sub>3</sub>H, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, first isolated in
  1890 by Th. Curtius (<i>Berichte</i>, 1890, 23, p. 3023). It is the
  hydrogen compound corresponding to P. Greiss' diazoimino benzene,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, which is prepared by the
  addition of ammonia to diazobenzene perbromide.</p>

  <p>Curtius found that benzoyl glycollic acid gave benzoyl hydrazine with
  hydrazine hydrate:</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[v.03 p.0083]</span></p>

  <p>(Ethyl benzoate may be employed instead of benzoyl glycollic acid for
  this reaction.) This compound gave a nitroso compound with nitrous acid,
  which changed spontaneously into benzoylazoimide by loss of water:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO·NH·NH<sub>2</sub> + HONO = H<sub>2</sub>O + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO·N(NO)·NH<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p class="i6">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO·N(NO)·NH<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO·N<sub>3</sub>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The resulting benzoylazoimide is easily hydrolysed by boiling with
  alcoholic solutions of caustic alkalis, a benzoate of the alkali metal
  and an alkali salt of the new acid being obtained; the latter is
  precipitated in crystalline condition on standing.</p>

  <p>An improved method of preparation was found in the use of hippuric
  acid, which reacts with hydrazine hydrate to form hippuryl hydrazine,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CONH·CH<sub>2</sub>CONH·NH<sub>2</sub>, and
  this substance is converted by nitrous acid into diazo-hippuramide,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CONH·CH<sub>2</sub>·CO·NH·N<sub>2</sub>·OH,
  which is hydrolysed by the action of caustic alkalis with the production
  of salts of hydrazoic acid. To obtain the free acid it is best to
  dissolve the diazo-hippuramide in dilute soda, warm the solution to
  ensure the formation of the sodium salt, and distil the resulting liquid
  with dilute sulphuric acid. The pure acid may be obtained by fractional
  distillation as a colourless liquid of very unpleasant smell, boiling at
  30° C., and extremely explosive. It is soluble in water, and the solution
  dissolves many metals (zinc, iron, &amp;c.) with liberation of hydrogen
  and formation of salts (azoimides, azides or hydrazoates). All the salts
  are explosive and readily interact with the alkyl iodides. In its
  properties it shows some analogy to the halogen acids, since it forms
  difficultly soluble lead, silver and mercurous salts. The metallic salts
  all crystallize in the anhydrous condition and decompose on heating,
  leaving a residue of the pure metal. The acid is a "weak" acid, being
  ionized only to a very slight extent in dilute aqueous solution.</p>

  <p>E. Noelting and E. Grandmougin (<i>Berichte</i>, 1891, 24, p. 2546)
  obtained azoimide from dinitraniline,
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·NH<sub>2</sub>, by
  diazotization and conversion of the diazo compound into the perbromide,
  (NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>·N<sub>2</sub>·Br<sub>3</sub>.
  This compound is then decomposed by ammonia, dinitrophenylhydrazoate
  being formed, which on hydrolysis with alcoholic potash gives potassium
  hydrazoate (azide) and dinitrophenol. The solution is then acidified and
  distilled, when azoimide passes over. Somewhat later, they found that it
  could be prepared from diazobenzene imide, provided a nitro group were
  present in the ortho or para position to the diazo group. The para-nitro
  compound is dropped slowly into a cold solution of one part of caustic
  potash in ten parts of absolute alcohol; the solution becomes dark red in
  colour and is then warmed for two days on the water bath. After the
  greater portion of the alcohol has distilled off, the solution is
  acidified with sulphuric acid and the azoimide distilled over. The yield
  obtained is only about 40% of that required by theory, on account of
  secondary reactions taking place. Ortho-nitro-diazobenzene imide only
  yields 30%.</p>

  <p>W. Wislicenus (<i>Berichte</i>, 1892, 25, p. 2084) has prepared the
  sodium salt by passing nitrous oxide over sodamide at high temperatures.
  The acid can also be obtained by the action of nitrous acid on hydrazine
  sulphate; by the oxidation of hydrazine by hydrogen peroxide and
  sulphuric acid (A.&nbsp;W. Browne, <i>J. Amer. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1905, 25, p.
  251), or by ammonium metavanadate (A.&nbsp;W. Browne and F.&nbsp;F. Shetterly,
  <i>Abst. J.C.S.</i>, 1907, ii. p. 863).</p>

  <p><i>Ammonium azoimide</i>, N<sub>3</sub>·NH<sub>4</sub>, may be
  prepared by boiling diazohippuramide with alcoholic ammonia, until no
  more ammonia escapes, the following reaction taking place:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO·NHCH<sub>2</sub>CONH·N<sub>2</sub>·OH + 2NH<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>3</sub>·NH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO·NH·CH<sub>2</sub>·CO·NH<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The liquid is then allowed to stand for twelve hours, and the clear
  alcoholic solution is decanted from the precipitated hippuramide. To the
  alcoholic solution, four times its volume of ether is added, when the
  ammonium salt is precipitated. It is then filtered, washed with ether,
  and air-dried. The salt is readily soluble in water, and is only feebly
  alkaline. It is extremely explosive. <i>Hydrazine azoimide</i>,
  N<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, is also known.</p>

  <p><i>Chloroazoimide</i>, Cl·N<sub>3</sub>, the chloride corresponding to
  azoimide, was obtained by F. Raschig (<i>Ber.</i>, 1908, 41, p. 4194) as
  a highly explosive colourless gas on acidifying a mixture of sodium azide
  and hypochlorite with acetic or boric acid.</p>

  <p><b>AZORES</b> (<i>Açores</i>), or <span class="sc">Western
  Islands</span>, an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, belonging to the
  kingdom of Portugal. Pop. (1900) 256,291; area, 922 sq. m. The Azores
  extend in an oblique line from N.W. to S.E., between 36° 55&prime; and
  39° 55&prime; N., and between 25° and 31° 16&prime; W. They are divided
  into three widely severed groups, rising from a depth of more than 2½ m.
  The south-eastern group consists of St Michael's (São Miguel) and St Mary
  (Santa Maria), with Formigas; the central, of Fayal (Faial), Pico, St
  George (São Jorge), Terceira and Graciosa; the north-western, of Flores
  and Corvo.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/azores_1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/azores_1.png"
      alt="Maps of the Azores." title="Maps of the Azores." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The nearest continental land is Cape da Roca on the Portuguese coast,
  which lies 830 m. E. of St Michael's; while Cape Cantin, the nearest
  point on the African mainland, is more than 900 m. distant, and Cape Race
  in Newfoundland, the nearest American headland, is more than 1000 m. Thus
  the Azores are the farthest from any continent of all the island groups
  in the Atlantic; but they are usually regarded as belonging to Europe, as
  their climate and flora are European in character.</p>

  <p><i>Physical Description.</i>&mdash;The aspect of all the islands is
  very similar in general characteristics, presenting an elevated and <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[v.03
  p.0084]</span>undulating outline, with little or no tableland, and rising
  into peaks, of which the lowest, that of Corvo, is 350 ft., and the
  highest that of Pico, 7612 ft. above sea-level. The lines of sea-coast
  are, with few exceptions, high and precipitous, with bases of accumulated
  masses of fallen rock, in which open bays, or scarcely more enclosed
  inlets, form the harbours of the trading towns. The volcanic character of
  the whole archipelago is obvious, and has been abundantly confirmed by
  the numerous earthquakes and eruptions which have taken place since its
  discovery. Basalt and scoria are the chief erupted materials. Hitherto
  Flores, Corvo and Graciosa have been quite exempt, and Fayal has only
  suffered from one eruption (1672). The centre of activity has for the
  most part been St Michael's, while the neighbouring island of St Mary has
  altogether escaped. In 1444-1445 there was a great eruption at St
  Michael's, of which, however, the accounts that have been preserved
  exaggerate the importance. In 1522 the town of Villa Franca, at that time
  the capital of the island, was buried, with all its 6000 inhabitants,
  during a violent convulsion. In 1572 an eruption took place in Pico; in
  1580 St George was the scene of numerous outbursts; and in 1614 a little
  town in Terceira was destroyed. In 1630, 1652, 1656, 1755, 1852, &amp;c.,
  St Michael's was visited with successive eruptions and earthquakes,
  several of them of great violence. On various occasions, as in 1638,
  1720, 1811 and 1867, subterranean eruptions have taken place, which have
  sometimes been accompanied by the appearance of temporary islands. Of
  these the most remarkable was thrown up in June 1811, about half a league
  from the western extremity of St Michael's. It was called Sabrina by the
  commander of the British man-of-war of that name, who witnessed the
  phenomenon.</p>

  <p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is particularly temperate, but the
  extremes of sensible heat and cold are increased by the humidity. The
  range of the thermometer is from 45° Fahr., the lowest known extreme, or
  48°, the ordinary lowest extreme of January, to 82°, the ordinary, or
  86°, the highest known extreme of July, near the level of the sea.
  Between these two points (both taken in the shade) there is from month to
  month a pretty regular gradation of increase or decrease, amounting to
  somewhat less than four degrees. In winter the prevailing winds are from
  the north-west, west and south; in summer the most frequent are the
  north, north-east and east. The weather is often extremely stormy, and
  the winds from the west and south-west render the navigation of the
  coasts very dangerous.</p>

  <p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The mammalia of the Azores are limited to the
  rabbit, weasel, ferret, rat (brown and black), mouse and bat, in addition
  to domestic animals. The game includes the woodcock, red partridge
  (introduced in the 16th century), quail and snipe. Owing to the damage
  inflicted on the crops by the multitude of blackbirds, bullfinches,
  chaffinches and green canaries, a reward was formerly paid for the
  destruction of birds in St Michael's, and it is said that over 400,000
  were destroyed in several successive years between 1875 and 1885. There
  are valuable fisheries of tunny, mullet and bonito. The porpoise, dolphin
  and whale are also common. Whale-fishing is a profitable industry, with
  its headquarters at Fayal, whence the sperm-oil is exported. Eels are
  found in the rivers. The only indigenous reptile is the lizard.
  Fresh-water molluscs are unknown, and near the coast the marine fauna is
  not rich; but terrestrial molluscs abound, several species being peculiar
  to the Azores.</p>

  <p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;The general character of the flora is decidedly
  European, no fewer than 400 out of the 478 species generally considered
  as indigenous belonging likewise to that continent, while only four are
  found in America, and forty are peculiar to the archipelago. Vegetation
  in most of the islands is remarkably rich, especially in grasses, mosses,
  and ferns, heath, juniper, and a variety of shrubs. Of tall-growing trees
  there was, till the 19th century, an almost total lack; but the Bordeaux
  pine, European poplar, African palm-tree, Australian eucalyptus,
  chestnut, tulip-tree, elm, oak, and many others, were then successfully
  introduced. The orange, apricot, banana, lemon, citron, Japanese medlar,
  and pomegranate are the common fruits, and various other varieties are
  more or less cultivated. At one time much attention was given to the
  growing of sugar-cane, but it has now for the most part been abandoned.
  The culture of indigo, introduced in the 16th century, also belongs to
  the past. A kind of fern (<i>Dicksonia culcita</i>), called by the
  natives <i>cabellinho</i>, furnishes a silky material for the stuffing of
  mattresses and is exported to Brazil and Portugal.</p>

  <p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of the islands are mostly of
  Portuguese origin, with a well-marked strain of Moorish and Flemish
  blood. There is a high birth-rate and a low average of infant mortality.
  A large proportion of the poorer classes, especially among the older men
  and women, are totally illiterate, but education tends to spread more
  rapidly than in Portugal itself, owing to the custom of sending children
  to the United States, where they are taught in the state schools.
  Negroes, mulattoes, English, Scottish and Irish immigrants are present in
  considerable numbers, especially in Fayal and St Michael's. The total
  number of resident foreigners in 1900 was 1490.</p>

  <p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;The Azores are subdivided into three
  administrative districts named after their chief towns, <i>i.e.</i> Ponta
  Delgada, the capital of St Michael's; Angra, or Angra do Heroismo, the
  capital of Terceira; and Horta, the capital of Fayal. St Michael's and St
  Mary are included in the district of Ponta Delgada; Terceira, St George
  and Graciosa, in that of Angra; Pico, Fayal, Flores and Corvo, in that of
  Horta. Four members are returned by Ponta Delgada to the parliament in
  Lisbon, while each of the other districts returns two members. Roman
  Catholicism is the creed of the majority, and Angra is an episcopal see.
  For purposes of military administration the islands form two commands,
  with their respective headquarters at Angra and Ponta Delgada. Besides
  the frequent and regular services of mails which connect the Azores with
  Portugal and other countries, there is a cable from Lisbon to Villa
  Franca do Campo, in St Michael's, and thence to Pico, Fayal, St George
  and Graciosa. Fayal is connected with Waterville, in Ireland, by a cable
  laid in 1901. At Angra and Ponta Delgada there are meteorological
  stations. The principal seaports are Angra (pop. 1900, 10,788), Ponta
  Delgada (17,620), and Horta (6574).</p>

  <p><i>Trade.</i>&mdash;The trade of the Azores, long a Portuguese
  monopoly, is now to a great extent shared by the United Kingdom and
  Germany, and is chiefly carried in British vessels. Textiles are imported
  from Portugal; coal from Great Britain; sugar from Germany, Madeira and
  the United States; stationery, hardware, chemicals, paints, oils,
  &amp;c., from the United Kingdom and Germany. The exports consist chiefly
  of fruit, wine, natural mineral waters and provisions. The trade in
  pineapples is especially important. No fewer than 940,000 pineapples were
  exported in 1902 and 1903, going in almost equal quantities to London and
  Hamburg. The fruit is raised under glass. Pottery, cotton fabrics,
  spirits, straw hats and tea are produced in the district of Ponta
  Delgada; linen and woollen goods, cheese, butter, soap, bricks and tiles,
  in that of Angra; baskets, mats, and various ornamental articles made
  from straw, osier, and the pith of dried fig-wood, in that of Horta.</p>

  <p>The largest and most populous of the Azores is St Michael's, which has
  an area of 297 sq. m., and in 1900 had 121,340 inhabitants. Graciosa
  (pop. 8385; area, 17 sq. m.) and St George (16,177; 40 sq. m.) form part
  of the central group. Graciosa is noteworthy for the beauty of its
  scenery. Its chief towns are Santa Cruz de Graciosa (2185) and Guadalupe
  (2717). The chief towns of St George are Ribeira Seca (2817) and Velas
  (2009).</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;It does not appear that the ancient Greeks and
  Romans had any knowledge of the Azores, but from the number of
  Carthaginian coins discovered in Corvo it has been supposed that the
  islands must have been visited by that adventurous people. The Arabian
  geographers, Edrisi in the 12th century, and Ibn-al-Wardi in the 14th,
  describe, after the Canaries, nine other islands in the Western Ocean,
  which are in all probability the Azores. This identification is supported
  by various considerations. The number of islands is the same; the climate
  under which they are placed by the Arabians makes them north of the
  Canaries; and special mention is made of the hawks or buzzards, which
  were sufficiently numerous at a later period to <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>[v.03 p.0085]</span>give rise to the
  present name (Port. <i>Açor</i>, a hawk). The Arabian writers represent
  them as having been populous, and as having contained cities of some
  magnitude; but they state that the inhabitants had been greatly reduced
  by intestine warfare. The Azores are first found distinctly marked in a
  map of 1351, the southern group being named the Goat Islands
  (<i>Cabreras</i>); the middle group, the Wind or Dove Islands (<i>De
  Ventura sive de Columbis</i>); and the western, the Brazil Island (<i>De
  Brazi</i>)&mdash;the word Brazil at that time being employed for any red
  dye-stuff. In a Catalan map of the year 1375 Corvo is found as <i>Corvi
  Marini</i>, and Flores as <i>Li Conigi</i>; while St George is already
  designated <i>San Zorze</i>. It has been conjectured that the discoverers
  were Genoese, but of this there is not sufficient evidence. It is plain,
  however, that the so-called Flemish discovery by van der Berg is only
  worthy of the name in a very secondary sense. According to the usual
  account, he was driven on the islands in 1432, and the news excited
  considerable interest at the court of Lisbon. The navigator, Gonzalo
  Velho Cabral&mdash;not to be confounded with his greater namesake, Pedro
  Alvarez Cabral&mdash;was sent to prosecute the discovery. Another version
  relates that Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal had in his possession
  a map in which the islands were laid down, and that he sent out Cabral
  through confidence in its accuracy. The map had been presented to him by
  his brother, Dom Pedro, who had travelled as far as Babylon. Be this as
  it may, Cabral reached the island, which he named <i>Santa Maria</i>, in
  1432, and in 1444 took possession of St Michael's. The other islands were
  all discovered by 1457. Colonization had meanwhile been going on
  prosperously; and in 1466 Fayal was presented by Alphonso V. to his aunt,
  Isabella, the duchess of Burgundy. An influx of Flemish settlers
  followed, and the islands became known for a time as the Flemish Islands.
  From 1580 to 1640 they were subject, like the rest of the Portuguese
  kingdom, to Spain. At that time the Azores were the grand rendezvous for
  the fleets on their voyage home from the Indies; and hence they became a
  theatre of that maritime warfare which was carried on by the English
  under Queen Elizabeth against the Peninsular powers. One such expedition,
  which took place in 1591, led to the famous sea-fight off Flores, between
  the English ship "Revenge," commanded by Sir Richard Grenville, and a
  Spanish fleet of fifty-three vessels. Under the active administration of
  the marquis de Pombal (1690-1782), considerable efforts were made for the
  improvement of the Azores, but the stupid and bigoted government which
  followed rather tended to destroy these benefits. Towards the beginning
  of the 19th century, the possession of the islands, was contested by the
  claimants for the crown of Portugal. The adherents of the constitution,
  who supported against Miguel the rights of Maria (II.) da Gloria,
  obtained possession of Terceira in 1829, where they succeeded in
  maintaining themselves, and after various struggles, Queen Maria's
  authority was established over all the islands. She resided at Angra from
  1830 to 1833.</p>

  Walker (London, 1886), and <i>Madeira and the Canary Islands, with the
  Azores</i>, by A.&nbsp;S. Brown (London, 1901). On the fauna and flora of the
  islands, the following books by H. Drouet are useful:&mdash;<i>Eléments

  Açores</i> (1858), <i>Lettres açoréennes</i> (1862), and <i>Catalogue de
  la flore des îles Açores, précédé de l'itinéraire d'une voyage dans cet
  archipel</i> (1866). The progress of Azorian commerce is best shown in
  the British and American consular reports. For history, see <i>La
  Conquista de las Azores en 1583</i>, by C. Fernandez Duro (Madrid, 1886),

  <p><b>AZOTH,</b> the name given by the alchemists to mercury, and by
  Paracelsus to his universal remedy.</p>

  <p><b>AZOTUS,</b> the name given by Greek and Roman writers to Ashdod, an
  ancient city of Palestine, now represented by a few remains in the little
  village of <i>&#x201B;Esdud</i>, in the governmental district of Acre. It
  was situated about 3 m. inland from the Mediterranean, on the famous
  military route between Syria and Egypt, about equidistant (18 m.) from
  Joppa and Gaza. As one of the five chief cities of the Philistines and
  the seat of the worship of Dagon (1 Sam. v.; cf. 1 Macc. x. 83), it
  maintained, down even to the days of the Maccabees, a vigorous though
  somewhat intermittent independence against the power of the Israelites,
  by whom it was nominally assigned to the territory of Judah. In 711 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> it was captured by the Assyrians (Is. xx. 1),
  but soon regained its power, and was strong enough in the next century to
  resist the assaults of Psammetichus, king of Egypt, for twenty-nine years
  (Herod. ii. 157). Restored by the Roman Gabinius from the ruins to which
  it had been reduced by the Jewish wars (1 Macc. v. 68, x. 77, xvi. 10),
  it was presented by Augustus to Salome, the sister of Herod. The only New
  Testament reference is in Acts viii. 40. Ashdod became the seat of a
  bishop early in the Christian era, but seems never to have attained any
  importance as a town. The Mount Azotus of 1 Macc. ix. 15, where Judas
  Maccabeus fell, is possibly the rising ground on which the village
  stands. A fine Saracenic kh&#x101;n is the principal relic of antiquity
  at &#x201B;Esdud.</p>

  <p><b>AZOV,</b> or Asov (in Turkish, <i>Asak</i>), a town of Russia, in
  the government of the Don Cossacks, on the left bank of the southern arm
  of the Don, about 20 m. from its mouth. The ancient Tanais lay some 10 m.
  to the north. In the 13th century the Genoese had a factory here which
  they called Tana. Azov was long a place of great military and commercial
  importance. Peter the Great obtained possession of it after a protracted
  siege in 1696, but in 1711 restored it to the Turks; in 1739 it was
  finally united to the Russian empire. Since then it has greatly declined,
  owing to the silting up of its harbour and the competition of Taganrog.
  Its population, principally engaged in the fisheries, numbered 25,124 in
  1900.</p>

  <p><b>AZOV, SEA OF</b> an inland sea of southern Europe, communicating
  with the Black Sea by the Strait of Yenikale, or Kerch, the ancient
  <i>Bosporus Cimmerius</i>. To the Romans it was known as the <i>Palus
  Maeotis</i>, from the name of the neighbouring people, who called it in
  their native language <i>Temarenda</i>, or Mother of Waters. It was long
  supposed to possess direct communication with the Northern Ocean. In
  prehistoric times a connexion with the Caspian Sea existed; but since the
  earliest historical times no great change has taken place in regard to
  the character or relations of the Sea of Azov. It lies between 45°
  20&prime; and 47° 18&prime; N. lat, and between 35° and 39° E. long., its
  length from south-west to north-east being 230 m., and its greatest
  breadth 110. The area runs to 14,515 sq. m. It generally freezes from
  November to the middle of April. The Don is its largest and, indeed, its
  only very important affluent. Near the mouth of that river the depth of
  the sea varies from 3 to 10 ft., and the greatest depth does not exceed
  45 ft. Of recent years, too, the level has been constantly dropping, for
  the surface lies 4¾ ft. higher than the surface of the Black Sea. Fierce
  and continuous winds from the east prevail during July and August, and in
  the latter part of the year those from the north-east and south-east are
  not unusual; a great variety of currents is thus produced. The water is
  for the most part comparatively fresh, but differs considerably in this
  respect according to locality and current. Fish are so abundant that the
  Turks describe it as <i>Baluk-deniz</i>, or Fish Sea. To the west,
  separated from the main basin by the long narrow sand-spit of Arabat, lie
  the remarkable lagoons and marshes known as the Sivash, or Putrid Sea;
  here the water is intensely salt. The Sea of Azov is of great importance
  to Russian commerce; along its shores stand the cities of Taganrog,
  Berdyansk, Mariupol and Yenikale.</p>

  <p><b>AZTECS</b> (from the Nahuatl word <i>aztlan</i>, "place of the
  Heron," or "Heron" people), the native name of one of the tribes that
  occupied the tableland of Mexico on the arrival of the Spaniards in
  America. It has been very frequently employed as equivalent to the
  collective national title of Nahuatlecas or Mexicans. The Aztecs came,
  according to native tradition, from a country to which they gave the name
  of Aztlan, usually supposed to lie towards the north-west, but the
  satisfactory localization of it is one of the greatest difficulties in
  Mexican history. The date of the exodus from Aztlan is equally
  undetermined, being fixed by various authorities in the 11th and by
  others in the 12th century. One Mexican manuscript gives a date
  equivalent to <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1164. They gradually
  increased their influence among other tribes, until, by union with the
  Toltecs, who occupied the tableland before them, they extended their
  empire to an area of from 18,000 to 20,000 square leagues. The researches
  of Humboldt gave the first clear insight into the early periods of their
  history. See <span class="sc">Mexico</span>; <span class="sc">Nahuatlan

  <p><b>AZUNI, DOMENICO ALBERTO</b> (1749-1827), Italian jurist, was born
  at Sassar, in Sardinia, in 1749. He studied law at Sassari and Turin, and
  in 1782 was made judge of the consulate at Nice. In 1786-1788 he
  published his <i>Dizionario Universale Ragionato della Giurisprudenza
  Mercantile</i>. In 1795 appeared his systematic work on the maritime law
  of Europe, <i>Sistema Universale dei Principii del Diritto Maritimo dell'
  Europa</i>, which he afterwards recast and translated into French. In
  1806 he was appointed one of the French commission engaged in drawing up
  a general code of commercial law, and in the following year he proceeded
  to Genoa as president of the court of appeal. After the fall of Napoleon
  in 1814, Azuni lived for a time in retirement at Genoa, till he was
  invited to Sardinia by Victor Emmanuel I., and appointed judge of the
  consulate at Cagliari, and director of the university library. He died at
  Cagliari in 1827. Azuni also wrote numerous pamphlets and minor works,
  chiefly on maritime law, an important treatise on the origin and progress
  of maritime law (Paris, 1810), and an historical, geographical and
  political account of Sardinia (1799, enlarged 1802).</p>

  <p><b>AZURARA, GOMES EANNES DE</b> (?-1474), the second notable
  Portuguese chronicler in order of date. He adopted the career of letters
  in middle life. He probably entered the royal library as assistant to
  Fernão Lopes (<i>q.v.</i>) during the reign of King Duarte (1433-1438),
  and he had sole charge of it in 1452. His <i>Chronicle of the Siege and
  Capture of Ceuta</i>, a supplement to the <i>Chronicle of King John
  I.</i>, by Lopes, dates from 1450, and three years later he completed the
  first draft of the <i>Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of
  Guinea</i>, our authority for the early Portuguese voyages of discovery
  down the African coast and in the ocean, more especially for those
  undertaken under the auspices of Prince Henry the Navigator. It contains
  some account of the life work of that prince, and has a biographical as
  well as a geographical interest. On the 6th of June 1454 Azurara became
  chief keeper of the archives and royal chronicler in succession to Fernão
  Lopes. In 1456 King Alphonso V. commissioned him to write the history of
  Ceuta, "the land-gate of the East," under the governorship of D. Pedro de
  Menezes, from its capture in 1415 until 1437, and he had it ready in
  1463. A year afterwards the king charged him with a history of the deeds
  of D. Duarte de Menezes, captain of Alcacer, and, proceeding to Africa,
  he spent a twelvemonth in the town collecting materials and studying the
  scenes of the events he was to describe, and in 1468 he completed the
  chronicle. Alphonso corresponded with Azurara on terms of affectionate
  intimacy, and no less than three <i>commendas</i> of the order of Christ
  rewarded his literary services. He has little of the picturesque
  ingenuousness of Lopes, and loved to display his erudition by quotations
  and philosophical reflections, showing that he wrote under the influence
  of the first Renaissance. Nearly all the leading classical, early
  Christian and medieval writers figure in his pages, and he was acquainted
  with the notable chronicles and romances of Europe and had studied the
  best Italian and Spanish authors. In addition, he had mastered the
  geographical system of the ancients and their astrology. As an historian
  he is laborious, accurate and conscientious, though his position did not
  allow him to tell the whole truth about his hero, Prince Henry.</p>

  <p>His works include: (1) <i>Chronica del Rei D. Joam I. Terceira parte
  em que se contem a tomada de Ceuta</i> (Lisbon, 1644); (2) <i>Chronica do
  Descobrimento e Conquista de Guiné</i> (Paris, 1841; Eng. version in 2
  vols. issued by the Hakluyt Society, London, 1896-1899); (3) <i>Chronica
  do Conde D. Pedro (de Menezes)</i>, printed in the <i>Ineditos de
  Historia Portugueza</i>, vol. ii. (Lisbon, 1792); (4) <i>Chronica do
  Conde D. Duarte de Menezes</i>, printed in the <i>Ineditos</i>, vol. iii.
  (Lisbon, 1793). The preface to the English version of the <i>Chronicle of
  Guinea</i> contains a full account of the life and writings of Azurara
  and cites all the authorities.</p>

  <p><b>AZURITE</b>, or <span class="sc">Chessylite</span>, a mineral which
  is a basic copper carbonate, 2CuCO<sub>3</sub>·Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>. In its
  vivid blue colour it contrasts strikingly with the emerald-green
  malachite, also a basic copper carbonate, but containing rather more
  water and less carbon dioxide. It was known to Pliny under the name
  <i>caeruleum</i>, and the modern name azurite (given by F.&nbsp;S. Beudant in
  1824) also has reference to the azure-blue colour; the name chessylite,
  also in common use, is of later date (1852), and is from the locality,
  Chessy near Lyons, which has supplied the best crystallized specimens of
  the mineral. Crystals of azurite belong to the monoclinic system; they
  have a vitreous lustre and are translucent. The streak is blue, but
  lighter than the colour of the mineral in mass. Hardness 3½&mdash;4; sp.
  gr. 3.8.</p>

  <p>Azurite occurs with malachite in the upper portions of deposits of
  copper ore, and owes its origin to the alteration of the sulphide or of
  native copper by water containing carbon dioxide and oxygen. It is thus a
  common mineral in all copper mines, and sometimes occurs in large masses,
  as in Arizona and in South Australia, where it has been worked as an ore
  of copper, of which element it contains 55%. Being less hydrated than
  malachite it is itself liable to alteration into this mineral, and
  pseudomorphs of malachite after azurite are not uncommon. Occasionally
  the massive material is cut and polished for decorative purposes, though
  the application in this direction is far less extensive than that of
  malachite.</p>

  leaven), a name given by the Orthodox Eastern to the Western or Latin
  Church, because of the latter's use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist,
  a practice which arose in the 9th century and is also observed by
  Armenians and Maronites following the Jewish passover custom. The
  Orthodox Church strenuously maintains its point, arguing that the very
  name bread, the holiness of the mystery, and the example of Jesus and the
  early church alike, testify against the use of unleavened bread in this
  connexion.</p>

  <p><b><span class="dropcap">B</span></b> This letter corresponds to the
  second symbol in the Phoenician alphabet, and appears in the same
  position in all the European alphabets, except those derived, like the
  Russian, from medieval Greek, in which the pronunciation of this symbol
  had changed from <i>b</i> to <i>v</i>. A new form had therefore to be
  invented for the genuine <i>b</i> in Slavonic, to which there was, at the
  period when the alphabet was adopted, no corresponding sound in Greek.
  The new symbol, which occupies the second position, was made by removing
  the upper loop of B, thus producing a symbol somewhat resembling an
  ordinary lowercase b. The old B retained the numerical value of the Greek
  <span class="grk">&beta;</span> as 2, and no numerical value was given to
  the new symbol. In the Phoenician alphabet the earliest forms are <a
  href="images/B_letter_1.png"><img src="images/B_letter_1.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Two Bs" /></a> or more rounded <a
  href="images/B_letter_2.png"><img src="images/B_letter_2.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="B" /></a>. The rounded form
  appears also in the earliest Aramaic (see <span
  class="sc">Alphabet</span>). Like some other alphabetic symbols it was
  not borrowed by Greek in its original form. In the very early rock
  inscriptions of Thera (700-600 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), written
  from right to left; it appears in a form resembling the ordinary Greek
  <span class="grk">&lambda;</span>; this form apparently arose from
  writing the Semitic symbol upside down. Its form in inscriptions of
  Melos, Selinus, Syracuse and elsewhere in the 6th and 5th centuries
  suggests the influence of Aramaic forms in which the head of the letter
  is opened, <a href="images/B_letter_3.png"><img
  src="images/B_letter_3.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="B"
  /></a>. The Corinthian <a href="images/B_letter_4.png"><img

  href="images/B_letter_6.png"><img src="images/B_letter_6.png"

  the <a href="images/B_letter_7.png"><img src="images/B_letter_7.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Two Bs" /></a> of Byzantine coins
  are other adaptations of the same symbol. The form <a
  href="images/B_letter_8.png"><img src="images/B_letter_8.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="B" /></a> which it takes in the
  alphabets of Naxos, Delos and other Ionic islands at the same period is
  difficult to explain. Otherwise its only variation is between pointed and
  rounded loops (<a href="images/B_letter_9.png"><img
  src="images/B_letter_9.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="B"
  /></a> and <a href="images/B_letter_10.png"><img
  src="images/B_letter_10.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="B"
  /></a>). The sound which the symbol represents is the voiced stop made by
  closing the lips and vibrating the vocal chords (see <span
  class="sc">Phonetics</span>). It differs from <i>p</i> by the presence of
  vibration of the vocal chords and from <i>m</i> because the nasal passage
  as well as the lips is closed. When an audible emission of breath attends
  its production the aspirate <i>bh</i> is formed. This sound was frequent
  in the pro-ethnic period of the Indo-European languages and survived into
  the Indo-Aryan languages. According to the system of phonetic changes
  generally known as "Grimm's law," an original <i>b</i> appears in English
  as <i>p</i>, an original <i>bh</i> as <i>b</i>. An original medial
  <i>p</i> preceding the chief accent of the word also appears as <i>b</i>
  in English and the other members of the same group. It is not certain
  that any English word is descended from an original word beginning with
  <i>b</i>, though it has been suggested that <i>peg</i> is of the same
  origin as the Latin <i>baculum</i> and the Greek <span title="baktron" class="grk"
  >&beta;&#x1F71;&kappa;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>. When the lips are
  not tightly closed the sound produced is not a stop, but a spirant like
  the English <i>w</i>. In Late Latin there was a tendency to this spirant
  pronunciation which appears as early as the beginning of the 2nd century
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>; by the 3rd century <i>b</i> and
  consonantal <i>u</i> are inextricably confused. When this consonantal
  <i>u</i> (English <i>w</i> as seen in words borrowed very early from
  Latin like <i>wall</i> and <i>wine</i>) passed into the sound of English
  <i>v</i> (labio-dental) is not certain, but Germanic words borrowed into
  Latin in the 5th century <span class="scac">A.D.</span> have in their
  Latin representation <i>gu</i>- for Germanic <i>w</i>-, <i>guisa</i>
  corresponding to English <i>wise</i> and reborrowed indirectly as
  <i>guise</i>.</p>

  <p>The earliest form of the name of the symbol which we can reach is the
  Hebrew <i>beth</i>, to which the Phoenician must have been closely akin,
  as is shown by the Greek <span title="bêta" class="grk"
  >&beta;&#x1FC6;&tau;&alpha;</span>, which is borrowed from it with a
  vowel affixed.</p>

  <p><b>BAADER, FRANZ XAVER VON</b> (1765-1841), German philosopher and
  theologian, born on the 27th of March 1765 at Munich, was the third son
  of F.&nbsp;P. Baader, court physician to the elector of Bavaria. His brothers
  were both distinguished&mdash;the elder, Clemens, as an author; the
  second, Joseph (1763-1835), as an engineer. Franz studied medicine at
  Ingolstadt and Vienna, and for a short time assisted his father in his
  practice. This life he soon found uncongenial, and decided on becoming a
  mining engineer. He studied under Abraham Gottlob Werner at Freiberg,
  travelled through several of the mining districts in north Germany, and
  for four years, 1792-1796, resided in England. There he became acquainted
  with the works of Jakob Boehme, and with the ideas of Hume, Hartley and
  Godwin, which were extremely distasteful to him. The mystical
  speculations of Meister Eckhart, Saint Martin, and above all those of
  Boehme, were more in harmony with his mode of thought. In 1796 he
  returned from England, and in Hamburg became acquainted with F.&nbsp;H.
  Jacobi, with whom he was for years on terms of friendship. He now learned
  something of Schelling, and the works he published during this period
  were manifestly influenced by that philosopher. Yet Baader is no disciple
  of Schelling, and probably gave out more than he received. Their
  friendship continued till about the year 1822, when Baader's denunciation
  of modern philosophy in his letter to the emperor Alexander I. of Russia
  entirely alienated Schelling.</p>

  <p>All this time Baader continued to apply himself to his profession of
  engineer. He gained a prize of 12,000 gulden (about £1000) for his new
  method of employing Glauber's salts instead of potash in the making of
  glass. From 1817 to 1820 he held the post of superintendent of mines, and
  was raised to the rank of nobility for his services. He retired in 1820,
  and soon after published one of the best of his works, <i>Fermenta
  Cognitionis</i>, 6 parts, 1822-1825, in which he combats modern
  philosophy and recommends the study of Boehme. In 1826, when the new
  university was opened at Munich, he was appointed professor of philosophy
  and speculative theology. Some of the lectures delivered there he
  published under the title, <i>Spekulative Dogmatik</i>, 4 parts,
  1827-1836. In 1838 he opposed the interference in civil matters of the
  Roman Catholic Church, to which he belonged, and in consequence was,
  during the last three years of his life, interdicted from lecturing on
  the philosophy of religion. He died on the 23rd of May 1841.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to summarize Baader's philosophy, for he himself
  generally gave expression to his deepest thoughts in obscure aphorisms,
  or mystical symbols and analogies (see Ed. Zeller's <i>Ges. d. deut.
  Phil.</i> 732, 736). Further, he has no systematic works; his doctrines
  exist for the most part in short detached essays, in comments on the
  writings of Boehme and Saint Martin, or in his extensive correspondence
  and journals. At the same time there are salient points which mark the
  outline of his thought. Baader starts from the position that human reason
  by itself can never reach the end it aims at, and maintains that we
  cannot throw aside the presuppositions of faith, church and tradition.
  His point of view may be described as Scholasticism; for, like the
  scholastic doctors, he believes that theology and philosophy are not
  opposed sciences, but that reason has to make clear the truths given by
  authority and revelation. But in his attempt to draw still closer the
  realms of faith and knowledge he approaches more nearly to the mysticism
  of Eckhart, Paracelsus and Boehme. Our existence depends on the fact that
  we are cognized by God (<i>cogitor ergo cogito et sum</i>). All
  self-consciousness is at the same time God-consciousness; our knowledge
  is never mere <i>scientia</i>, it is invariably
  <i>con-scientia</i>&mdash;a knowing with, consciousness of, or
  participation in God. Baader's philosophy is thus essentially a
  theosophy. God is not to be conceived as mere abstract Being
  (<i>substantia</i>), but as everlasting process, activity (<i>actus</i>).
  Of this process, this self-generation of God, we may distinguish two
  aspects&mdash;the immanent or esoteric, and the emanent or exoteric. God
  has reality only in so far as He is absolute spirit, and only in so far
  as the primitive will is conscious of itself can it become spirit at all.
  But in this very cognition of self is involved the distinction of knower
  and known, from which proceeds the power to become spirit. This immanent
  process of self-consciousness, wherein indeed a trinity of persons is not
  given but only rendered possible, is mirrored in, and takes place
  through, the eternal and impersonal idea or wisdom of God, which exists
  beside, though not distinct from, the primitive will. Concrete reality or
  personality is given to this divine <i>Ternar</i>, as Baader calls it,
  through <i>nature</i>, the principle of self-hood, of individual being,
  which is eternally and necessarily produced by God. Only in nature is the
  trinity of <i>persons</i> attained. These processes, it must be noticed,
  are not to be conceived as successive, or as taking place in time; they
  are to be looked at <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>, as the necessary
  elements or moments in the self-evolution of the divine Being. Nor is
  <i>nature</i> to be confounded with created substance, or with matter as
  it exists in space and time; it is pure non-being, the mere otherness
  (<i>alteritas</i>) of God-his shadow, desire, want, or <i>desiderium
  sui</i>, as it is called by mystical writers. Creation, itself a free and
  non-temporal act of God's love and will, cannot be speculatively deduced,
  but must be accepted as an historic <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>[v.03 p.0088]</span>fact. Created
  beings were originally of three orders&mdash;the intelligent or angels;
  the non-intelligent natural existences; and man, who mediated between
  these two orders. Intelligent beings are endowed with freedom; it is
  possible, but not necessary, that they should fall. Hence the fact of the
  fall is not a speculative but an historic truth. The angels fell through
  pride&mdash;through desire to raise themselves to equality with God; man
  fell by lowering himself to the level of nature. Only after the fall of
  man begins the creation of space, time and matter, or of the world as we
  now know it; and the motive of this creation was the desire to afford man
  an opportunity for taking advantage of the scheme of redemption, for
  bringing forth in purity the image of God according to which he has been
  fashioned. The physical philosophy and anthropology which Baader, in
  connexion with this, unfolds in various works, is but little instructive,
  and coincides in the main with the utterances of Boehme. In nature and in
  man he finds traces of the dire effects of sin, which has corrupted both
  and has destroyed their natural harmony. As regards ethics, Baader
  rejects the Kantian or any autonomic system of morals. Not obedience to a
  moral law, but realization in ourselves of the divine life is the true
  ethical end. But man has lost the power to effect this by himself; he has
  alienated himself from God, and therefore no ethical theory which
  neglects the facts of sin and redemption is satisfactory or even
  possible. The history of man and of humanity is the history of the
  redeeming love of God. The means whereby we put ourselves so in relation
  with Christ as to receive from Him his healing virtue are chiefly prayer
  and the sacraments of the church; mere works are never sufficient. Man in
  his social relations is under two great institutions. One is temporal,
  natural and limited&mdash;the state; the other is eternal, cosmopolitan
  and universal&mdash;the church. In the state two things are requisite:
  first, common submission to the ruler, which can be secured or given only
  when the state is Christian, for God alone is the true ruler of men; and,
  secondly, inequality of rank, without which there can be no organization.
  A despotism of mere power and liberalism, which naturally produces
  socialism, are equally objectionable. The ideal state is a civil
  community ruled by a universal or Catholic church, the principles of
  which are equally distinct from mere passive pietism, or faith which will
  know nothing, and from the Protestant doctrine, which is the very
  radicalism of reason.</p>

  <p>Baader is, without doubt, among the greatest speculative theologians
  of modern Catholicism, and his influence has extended itself even beyond
  the precincts of his own church. Among those whom he influenced were R.
  Rothe, Julius Müller and Hans L. Markensen.</p>

  <p>His works were collected and published by a number of his
  adherents&mdash;F. Hoffman, J. Hamberger, E. v. Schaden, Lutterbeck, von
  Osten-Sacken and Schlüter&mdash;<i>Baader's sämmtliche Werke</i> (16
  vols., 1851-1860). Valuable introductions by the editors are prefixed to
  the several volumes. Vol. xv. contains a full biography; vol. xvi. an
  index, and an able sketch of the whole system by Lutterbeck. See F.

  <p><b>BAAL,</b> a Semitic word, which primarily signifies lord, owner or
  inhabitant,<a name="FnAnchor_061" href="#Footnote_061"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  and then, in accordance with the Semitic way of looking at family and
  religious relations, is specially appropriated to express the relation of
  a husband to his wife and of the deity to his worshipper. In the latter
  usage it indicated not that the god was the lord of the worshipper, but
  rather the possessor of, or ruler in, some place or district. In the Old
  Testament it is regularly written with the article, <i>i.e.</i>
  "<i>the</i> Baal"; and the baals of different tribes or sanctuaries were
  not necessarily conceived as identical, so that we find frequent mention
  of Baalim, or rather "<i>the</i> Baalim" in the plural. That the
  Israelites even applied the title of Baal to Yahweh himself is proved by
  the occurrence of such names as Jerubbaal (Gideon), Eshbaal (one of
  Saul's sons) and Beeliada (a son of David, 1 Chron. xiv. 7). The last
  name appears in 2 Sam. v. 16 as Eliada, showing that El (God) was
  regarded as equivalent to Baal; cf. also the name Be&#x201B;aliah,
  "Yahweh is <i>baal</i> or lord," which survives in 1 Chron. xii. 5.
  However, when the name Baal was exclusively appropriated to idolatrous
  worship (cf. Hos. ii. 16 seq.), abhorrence for the unholy word was marked
  by writing <i>b&#x14D;sheth</i> (shameful thing) for <i>baal</i> in
  compound proper names, and thus we get the usual forms Ishbosheth,
  Mephibosheth.</p>

  <p>The great difficulty which has been felt by investigators in
  determining the character and attributes of the god Baal mainly arises
  from the original appellative sense of the word, and many obscure points
  become clear if we remember that when a title becomes a proper name it
  may be appropriated by different peoples to quite distinct deities. Baal
  being originally a title, and not a proper name, the innumerable baals
  could be distinguished by the addition of the name of a place or of some
  special attribute.<a name="FnAnchor_062"
  href="#Footnote_062"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Accordingly, the baals are not to
  be regarded necessarily as local variations of one and the same god, like
  the many Virgins or Madonnas of Catholic lands, but as distinct
  <i>numina</i>. Each community could speak of its own baal, although a
  collection of allied communities might share the same cult, and
  naturally, since the attributes ascribed to the individual baals were
  very similar, subsequent syncretism was facilitated.</p>

  <p>The Baal, as the head of each worshipping group, is the source of all
  the gifts of nature (cf. Hos. ii. 8 seq., Ezek. xvi. 19); as the god of
  fertility all the produce of the soil is his, and his adherents bring to
  him their tribute of first-fruits. He is the patron of all growth and
  fertility, and, by the "uncontrolled use of analogy characteristic of
  early thought," the Baal is the god of the productive element in its
  widest sense. Originating probably, in the observation of the fertilizing
  effect of rains and streams upon the receptive and reproductive soil,
  baalism becomes identical with the grossest nature-worship. Joined with
  the baals there are naturally found corresponding female figures known as
  Asht&#x101;r&#x14D;th, embodiments of Asht&#x14D;reth (see <span
  class="sc">Astarte</span>; <span class="sc">Ishtar</span>). In accordance
  with primitive notions of analogy,<a name="FnAnchor_063"
  href="#Footnote_063"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which assume that it is possible
  to control or aid the powers of nature by the practice of "sympathetic
  magic" (see <span class="sc">Magic</span>), the cult of the baals and
  Asht&#x101;r&#x14D;th was characterized by gross sensuality and
  licentiousness.</p>

  <p>The fragmentary allusions to the cult of Baal Peor (Num. xxv., Hos.
  ix. 10, Ps. cvi. 28 seq.) exemplify the typical species of Dionysiac
  orgies that prevailed.<a name="FnAnchor_064"
  href="#Footnote_064"><sup>[4]</sup></a> On the summits of hills and
  mountains flourished the cult of the givers of increase, and "under every
  green tree" was practised the licentiousness which in primitive thought
  was held to secure abundance of crops (see Frazer, <i>Golden Bough</i>,
  2nd ed. vol. ii. pp. 204 sqq.). Human sacrifice (Jer. xix. 5), the
  burning of incense (Jer. vii. 9), violent and ecstatic exercises,
  ceremonial acts of bowing and kissing, the preparing of sacred mystic
  cakes, appear among the offences denounced by the Israelite prophets, and
  show that the cult of Baal (and Astarte) included the characteristic
  features of heathen worship which recur in various parts of the Semitic
  world, although attached to other names.<a name="FnAnchor_065"
  href="#Footnote_065"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>By an easy transition the local gods of the streams and springs which
  fertilized the increase of the fields became identified with <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>[v.03 p.0089]</span>the
  common source of all streams, and proceeding along this line it was
  possible for the numerous baals to be regarded eventually as mere forms
  of one absolute deity. Consequently, the Baal could be identified with
  some supreme power of nature, <i>e.g.</i> the heavens, the sun, the
  weather or some planet. The particular line of development would vary in
  different places, but the change from an association of the Baal with
  earthly objects to heavenly is characteristic of a higher type of belief
  and appears to be relatively later. The idea which has long prevailed
  that Baal was properly a sky-god affords no explanation of the local
  character of the many baals; on the other hand, on the theory of a higher
  development where the gods become heavenly or astral beings, the fact
  that ruder conceptions of nature were still retained (often in the
  unofficial but more popular forms of cult) is more intelligible.</p>

  <p>A specific Baal of the heavens appears to have been known among the
  Hittites in the time of Rameses II., and considerably later, at the
  beginning of the 7th century, it was the title of one of the gods of
  Phoenicia. In Babylonia, from a very early period, Baal became a definite
  individual deity, and was identified with the planet Jupiter. This
  development is a mark of superior culture and may have been spread
  through Babylonian influence. Both Baal and Astarte were venerated in
  Egypt at Thebes and Memphis in the XIXth Dynasty, and the former, through
  the influence of the Aramaeans who borrowed the Babylonian spelling Bel,
  ultimately became known as the Greek Belos who was identified with
  Zeus.</p>

  <p>Of the worship of the Tyrian Baal, who is also called Melkart (king of
  the city), and is often identified with the Greek Heracles, but sometimes
  with the Olympian Zeus, we have many accounts in ancient writers, from
  Herodotus downwards. He had a magnificent temple in insular Tyre, founded
  by Hiram, to which gifts streamed from all countries, especially at the
  great feasts. The solar character of this deity appears especially in the
  annual feast of his awakening shortly after the winter solstice (Joseph.
  <i>C. Apion.</i> i. 18). At Tyre, as among the Hebrews, Baal had his
  symbolical pillars, one of gold and one of smaragdus, which, transported
  by phantasy to the farthest west, are still familiar to us as the Pillars
  of Hercules. The worship of the Tyrian Baal was carried to all the
  Phoenician colonies.<a name="FnAnchor_066"
  href="#Footnote_066"><sup>[6]</sup></a> His name occurs as an element in
  Carthaginian proper names (Hanni<i>bal</i>, Hasdru<i>bal</i>, &amp;c.),
  and a tablet found at Marseilles still survives to inform us of the
  charges made by the priests of the temple of Baal for offering
  sacrifices.</p>

  <p>The history of Baalism among the Hebrews is obscured by the difficulty
  of determining whether the false worship which the prophets stigmatize is
  the heathen worship of Yahweh under a conception, and often with rites,
  which treated him as a local nature god; or whether Baalism was
  consciously recognized to be distinct from Yahwism from the first. Later
  religious practice was undoubtedly opposed to that of earlier times, and
  attempts were made to correct narratives containing views which had come
  to be regarded as contrary to the true worship of Yahweh. The Old
  Testament depicts the history of the people as a series of acts of
  apostasy alternating with subsequent penitence and return to Yahweh, and
  the question whether this gives effect to actual conditions depends upon
  the precise character of the elements of Yahweh worship brought by the
  Israelites into Palestine. This is still under dispute. There is strong
  evidence at all events that many of the conceptions are contrary to
  historical fact, and the points of similarity between native Canaanite
  cult and Israelite worship are so striking that only the persistent
  traditions of Israel's origin and of the work of Moses compel the
  conclusion that the germs of specific Yahweh worship existed from his
  day. The earliest certain reaction against Baalism is ascribed to the
  reign of Ahab, whose marriage with Jezebel gave the impulse to the
  introduction of a particular form of the cult. In honour of his wife's
  god, the king, following the example of Solomon, erected a temple to the
  Tyrian Baal (see above). This, however, did not prevent him from
  remaining a follower of Yahweh, whose prophets he still consulted, and
  whose protection he still cherished when he named his sons Ahaziah and
  Jehoram ("Yah[weh] holds," "Y. is high"). The antagonism of Elijah was
  not against Baalism in general, but against the introduction of a rival
  deity. But by the time of Hosea (ii. 16 seq.) a further advance was
  marked, and the use of the term "Baal" was felt to be dangerous to true
  religion. Thus there gradually grew up a tendency to avoid the term, and
  in accordance with the idea of Ex. xxiii. 13, it was replaced by the
  contemptuous <i>b&#x14D;sheth</i>, "shame" (see above). However, the
  books of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah (cf. also Zeph. i. 4) afford complete
  testimony for the prevalence of Baalism as late as the exile, but prove
  that the clearest distinction was then drawn between the pure worship of
  Yahweh the god of Israel and the inveterate and debased cults of the gods
  of the land. (See further <span class="sc">Hebrew Religion</span>; <span

  <p><b>BAALBEK</b> (anc. <i>Heliopolis</i>), a town of the Buka&#x201B;a
  (Coelesyria), altitude 3850 ft., situated E. of the Litani and near the
  parting between its waters and those of the Asi. Pop. about 5000,
  including 2000 Metawali and 1000 Christians (Maronite and Orthodox).
  Since 1902 Baalbek has been connected by railway with Rayak (Rejak) on
  the Beirut-Damascus line, and since 1907 with Aleppo. It is famous for
  its temple ruins of the Roman period, before which we have no record of
  it, certain though it be that Heliopolis is a translation of an earlier
  native name, in which Baal was an element. It has been suggested, but
  without good reason, that this name was the Baalgad of Josh. xi. 17.</p>

  <p>Heliopolis was made a <i>colonia</i> probably by Octavian (coins of
  1st century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>), and there must have been a
  Baal temple there in which Trajan consulted the oracle. The foundation of
  the present buildings, however, dates from Antoninus Pius, and their
  dedication from Septimius Severus, whose coins first show the two
  temples. The great courts of approach were not finished before the reigns
  of Caracalla and Philip. In commemoration, no doubt, of the dedication of
  the new sanctuaries, Severus conferred the <i>jus Italicum</i> on the
  city. The greater of the two temples was sacred to Jupiter (Baal),
  identified with the Sun, with whom were associated Venus and Mercury as
  <span title="sumbômoi theoi" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&#x1F7B;&mu;&beta;&omega;&mu;&omicron;&iota;
  &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#x1F77;</span>. The lesser temple was built in
  honour of Bacchus (not the Sun, as formerly believed). Jupiter-Baal was
  represented locally as a beardless god in long scaly drapery, holding a
  whip in his right hand and lightning and ears of corn in his left. Two
  bulls supported him. In this guise he passed into European worship in the
  3rd and 4th centuries <span class="scac">A.D.</span> The extreme licence
  of the Heliopolitan worship is often animadverted upon by early Christian
  writers, and Constantine, making an effort to curb the Venus cult, built
  a basilica. Theodosius erected another, with western apse, in the main
  court of the Jupiter temple.</p>

  <p>When Abu Ubaida (or Obaida) attacked the place after the Moslem
  capture of Damascus (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 635), it was still an
  opulent city and yielded a rich booty. It became a bone of contention
  between the various Syrian dynasties and the caliphs first of Damascus,
  then of Egypt, and in 748 was sacked with great slaughter. In 1090 it
  passed to the Seljuks, and in 1134 to Jenghiz Khan; but after 1145 it
  remained attached to Damascus and was captured by Saladin in 1175. The
  Crusaders raided its valley more than once, but never took the city.
  Three times shaken by earthquake in the 12th century, it was dismantled
  by Hulagu in 1260. But it revived, and most of its fine Moslem mosque and
  fortress architecture, still extant, belongs to the <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[v.03 p.0090]</span>reign of Sultan
  Kala&#x16B;n (1282) and the succeeding century, during which Abulfeda
  describes it as a very strong place. In 1400 Timur pillaged it, and in
  1517 it passed, with the rest of Syria, to the Ottoman dominion. But
  Ottoman jurisdiction was merely nominal in the Lebanon district, and
  Baalbek was really in the hands of the Metawali (see <span
  class="sc">Lebanon</span>), who retained it against other Lebanon tribes,
  until "Jezzar" Pasha, the rebel governor of the Acre province, broke
  their power in the last half of the 18th century. The anarchy which
  succeeded his death in 1804 was only ended by the Egyptian occupation
  (1832). With the treaty of London (1840) Baalbek became really Ottoman,
  and since the settlement of the Lebanon (1864) has attracted great
  numbers of tourists.</p>

  <p>The ruins were brought to European notice by Pierre Belon in 1555,
  though previously visited, in 1507, by Martin von Baumgarten. Much
  damaged by the earthquake of 1759, they remained a wilderness of fallen
  blocks till 1901, when their clearance was undertaken by the German
  Archaeological Institute and entrusted to the direction of Prof. O.
  Puchstein. They lie mainly on the ancient Acropolis, which has been
  shored up with huge walls to form a terrace raised on vaults and
  measuring about 1100 ft. from E. to W. The <i>Propylaea</i> lie at the E.
  end, and were approached by a flight of steps now quarried away. These
  propylaea formed a covered hall, or vestibule, about 35 ft. deep, flanked
  with towers richly decorated within and without (much damaged by Arab
  reconstruction). Columns stood in front, whose bases still exist and bear
  the names of Antoninus Pius and Julia Domna. Hence, through a triple
  gateway in a richly ornamented screen, access is gained to the first or
  Hexagonal Court, which measures about 250 ft. from angle to angle. It is
  now razed almost to foundation level; but it can be seen that it was
  flanked with halls each having four columns in front. A portal on the W.,
  50 ft. wide, flanked by lesser ones 10 ft. wide (that on the N. is alone
  preserved), admitted to the Main Court, in whose centre was the High
  Altar of Burnt Sacrifice. This altar and a great tank on the N. were
  covered by the foundations of Theodosius' basilica and not seen till the
  recent German clearance. The Main Court measures about 440 ft. from E. to
  W. and 370 ft. from N. to S., thus covering about 3½ acres. It had a
  continuous fringe of covered halls of various dimensions and shapes, once
  richly adorned with statues and columnar screens. Some of these halls are
  in fair preservation. Stairs on the W. led up to the temple of
  Jupiter-Baal, now much ruined, having only 6 of the 54 columns of its
  peristyle erect. Three fell in the earthquake of 1759. Those still
  standing are Nos. 11 to 16 in the southern rank. Their bases and shafts
  are not finished, though the capitals and rich entablature seem
  completely worked. They have a height of 60 ft. and diameter of 7½ ft.,
  and are mostly formed of three blocks. The architrave is threefold and
  bears a frieze with lion-heads, on which rest a moulding and cornice.</p>

  <p>The temple of Bacchus stood on a platform of its own formed by a
  southern projection of the Acropolis. It was much smaller than the
  Jupiter temple, but is better preserved. The steps of the E. approach
  were intact up to 1688. The temple was peripteral with 46 columns in its
  peristyle. These were over 52 ft. in height and of the Corinthian order,
  and supported an entablature 7 ft. high with double frieze, connected
  with the cella walls by a coffered ceiling, which contained slabs with
  heads of gods and emperors. Richard Burton, when consul-general at
  Damascus in 1870, cleared an Arab screen out of the vestibule, and in
  consequence the exquisite doorway leading into the cella can now be well
  seen. On either side of it staircases constructed within columns lead to
  the roof. The cracked door-lintel, which shows an eagle on the soffit,
  was propped up first by Burton, and lately, more securely, by the
  Germans. The cella, now ruinous, had inner wall-reliefs and engaged
  columns, which supported rich entablatures.</p>

  <p>The vaults below the Great Court of the Jupiter Temple, together with
  the supporting walls of the terrace, are noticeable. In the W. wall of
  the latter occur the three famous megaliths, which gave the name
  <i>Trilithon</i> to the Jupiter temple in Byzantine times. These measure
  from 63 to 64 ft. in length and 13 ft. in height and breadth, and have
  been raised 20 ft. above the ground. They are the largest blocks known to
  have been used in actual construction, but are excelled by another block
  still attached to its bed in the quarries half a mile S.W. This is 68 ft.
  long by 14 ft. high and weighs about 1500 tons. For long these blocks
  were supposed, even by European visitors, to be relics of a primeval race
  of giant builders.</p>

  <p>In the town, below the Acropolis, on the S.E. is a small temple of the
  late imperial age, consisting of a semicircular cella with a peristyle of
  eight Corinthian columns, supporting a projecting entablature. The cella
  is decorated without with a frieze, and within with pillars and arcading.
  This temple owes its preservation to its use as a church of St Barbara, a
  local martyr, also claimed by the Egyptian Heliopolis. Hence the building
  is known as Barbarat al-atika. Considerable remains of the N. gate of the
  city have also been exposed.</p>

  <p><b>BAARN,</b> a small town in the province of Utrecht, Holland, 5 m.
  by rail E. of Hilversum, at the junction of a branch line to Utrecht.
  Like Hilversum it is situated in the midst of picturesque and wooded
  surroundings, and is a favourite summer resort of people from Amsterdam.
  The Baarnsche Bosch, or wood, stretches southward to Soestdyk, where
  there is a royal <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>[v.03 p.0091]</span>country-seat, originally acquired
  by the state in 1795. Louis Bonaparte, king of Holland, who was very fond
  of the spot, formed a zoological collection here which was removed to
  Amsterdam in 1809. In 1816 the estate was presented by the nation to the
  prince of Orange (afterwards King William II.) in recognition of his
  services at the battle of Quatre Bras. Since then the palace and grounds
  have been considerably enlarged and beautified. Close to Baarn in the
  south-west were formerly situated the ancient castles of Drakenburg and
  Drakenstein, and at Vuursche there is a remarkable dolmen.</p>

  <p><b>BABADAG,</b> or <span class="sc">Babatag</span>, a town in the
  department of Tulcea, Rumania; situated on a small lake formed by the
  river Taitza among the densely wooded highlands of the northern Dobrudja.
  Pop. (1900) about 3500. The Taitza lake is divided only by a strip of
  marshland from Lake Razim, a broad landlocked sheet of water which opens
  on the Black Sea. Babadag is a market for the wool and mutton of the
  Dobrudja. It was founded by Bayezid I., sultan of the Turks from 1389 to
  1403. It occasionally served as the winter headquarters of the Turks in
  their wars with Russia, and was bombarded by the Russians in 1854.</p>

  <p><b>BABBAGE, CHARLES</b> (1792-1871), English mathematician and
  mechanician, was born on the 26th of December 1792 at Teignmouth in
  Devonshire. He was educated at a private school, and afterwards entered
  St Peter's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1814. Though he did
  not compete in the mathematical tripos, he acquired a great reputation at
  the university. In the years 1815-1817 he contributed three papers on the
  "Calculus of Functions" to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, and in
  1816 was made a fellow of the Royal Society. Along with Sir John Herschel
  and George Peacock he laboured to raise the standard of mathematical
  instruction in England, and especially endeavoured to supersede the
  Newtonian by the Leibnitzian notation in the infinitesimal calculus.
  Babbage's attention seems to have been very early drawn to the number and
  importance of the errors introduced into astronomical and other
  calculations through inaccuracies in the computation of tables. He
  contributed to the Royal Society some notices on the relation between
  notation and mechanism; and in 1822, in a letter to Sir H. Davy on the
  application of machinery to the calculation and printing of mathematical
  tables, he discussed the principles of a calculating engine, to the
  construction of which he devoted many years of his life. Government was
  induced to grant its aid, and the inventor himself spent a portion of his
  private fortune in the prosecution of his undertaking. He travelled
  through several of the countries of Europe, examining different systems
  of machinery; and some of the results of his investigations were
  published in the admirable little work, <i>Economy of Machines and
  Manufactures</i> (1834). The great calculating engine was never
  completed; the constructor apparently desired to adopt a new principle
  when the first specimen was nearly complete, to make it not a difference
  but an analytical engine, and the government declined to accept the
  further risk (see <span class="sc">Calculating Machines</span>). From
  1828 to 1839 Babbage was Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge.
  He contributed largely to several scientific periodicals, and was
  instrumental in founding the Astronomical (1820) and Statistical (1834)
  Societies. He only once endeavoured to enter public life, when, in 1832,
  he stood unsuccessfully for the borough of Finsbury. During the later
  years of his life he resided in London, devoting himself to the
  construction of machines capable of performing arithmetical and even
  algebraical calculations. He died at London on the 18th of October 1871.
  He gives a few biographical details in his <i>Passages from the Life of a
  Philosopher</i> (1864), a work which throws considerable light upon his
  somewhat peculiar character. His works, pamphlets and papers were very
  numerous; in the <i>Passages</i> he enumerates eighty separate writings.
  Of these the most important, besides the few already mentioned, are
  <i>Tables of Logarithms</i> (1826); <i>Comparative View of the Various
  Institutions for the Assurance of Lives</i> (1826); <i>Decline of Science
  in England</i> (1830); <i>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</i> (1837); <i>The
  Exposition of 1851</i> (1851).</p>

  <p><b>BABEL,</b> the native name of the city called Babylon (<i>q.v.</i>)
  by the Greeks, the modern <i>Hillah</i>. It means "gate of the god," not
  "gate of the gods," corresponding to the Assyrian <i>B&#x101;b-ili</i>.
  According to Gen. xi 1-9 (J), mankind, after the deluge, travelled from
  the mountain of the East, where the ark had rested, and settled in
  Shinar. Here they attempted to build a city and a tower whose top might
  reach unto heaven, but were miraculously prevented by their language
  being confounded. In this way the diversity of human speech and the
  dispersion of mankind were accounted for; and in Gen. xi. 9 (J) an
  etymology was found for the name of Babylon in the Hebrew verb
  <i>b&#x101;lal</i>, "to confuse or confound," Babel being regarded as a
  contraction of Balbel. In Gen. x. 10 it is said to have formed part of
  the kingdom of Nimrod.</p>

  <p>The origin of the story has not been found in Babylonia. The tower was
  no doubt suggested by one of the temple towers of Babylon. W.&nbsp;A. Bennet
  (<i>Genesis</i>, p. 169; cf. Hommel in Hastings' <i>Dictionary of the
  Bible</i>) suggests E-Saggila, the great temple of Merodach (Marduk). The
  variety of languages and the dispersion of mankind were regarded as a
  curse, and it is probable that, as Prof. Cheyne (<i>Encyclopaedia
  Biblica</i>, col. 411) says, there was an ancient North Semitic myth to
  explain it. The event was afterwards localized in Babylon. The myth, as
  it appears in Genesis, is quite polytheistic and anthropomorphic.
  According to Cornelius Alexander (frag. 10) and Abydenus (frags. 5 and 6)
  the tower was overthrown by the winds; according to Yaqut (i. 448 f.) and
  the Lisan el-&#x201B;Arab (xiii. 72) mankind were swept together by winds
  into the plain afterwards called "Babil," and were scattered again in the
  same way (see further D.&nbsp;B. Macdonald in the <i>Jewish
  Encyclopaedia</i>). A tradition similar to that of the tower of Babel is
  found in Central America. Xelhua, one of the seven giants rescued from
  the deluge, built the great pyramid of Cholula in order to storm heaven.
  The gods, however, destroyed it with fire and confounded the language of
  the builders. Traces of a somewhat similar story have also been met with
  among the Mongolian Tharus in northern India (<i>Report of the Census of
  Bengal</i>, 1872, p. 160), and, according to Dr Livingstone, among the
  Africans of Lake Ngami. The Esthonian myth of "the Cooking of Languages"
  (Kohl, <i>Reisen in die Ostseeprovinzen</i>, ii. 251-255) may also be
  compared, as well as the Australian legend of the origin of the diversity
  of speech (Gerstäcker, <i>Reisen</i>, vol. iv. pp. 381 seq.).</p>

  <p><b>BAB-EL-MANDEB</b> (Arab, for "The Gate of Tears"), the strait
  between Arabia and Africa which connects the Red Sea (<i>q.v.</i>) with
  the Indian Ocean. It derives its name from the dangers attending its
  navigation, or, according to an Arabic legend, from the numbers who were
  drowned by the earthquake which separated Asia and Africa. The distance
  across is about 20 m. from Ras Menheli on the Arabian coast to Ras Siyan
  on the African. The island of Perim (<i>q.v.</i>), a British possession,
  divides the strait into two channels, of which the eastern, known as the
  Bab Iskender (Alexander's Strait), is 2 m. wide and 16 fathoms deep,
  while the western, or Dact-el-Mayun, has a width of about 16 m. and a
  depth of 170 fathoms. Near the African coast lies a group of smaller
  islands known as the "Seven Brothers." There is a surface current inwards
  in the eastern channel, but a strong under-current outwards in the
  western channel.</p>

  <p><b>BABENBERG,</b> the name of a Franconian family which held the duchy
  of Austria before the rise of the house of Habsburg. Its earliest known
  ancestor was one Poppo, who early in the 9th century was count in
  Grapfeld. One of his sons, Henry, called margrave and duke in Franconia,
  fell fighting against the Normans in 886; another, Poppo, was margrave in
  Thuringia from 880 to 892, when he was deposed by the German king Arnulf.
  The family had been favoured by the emperor Charles the Fat, but Arnulf
  reversed this policy in favour of the rival family of the Conradines. The
  leaders of the Babenbergs were the three sons of Duke Henry, who called
  themselves after their castle of Babenberg on the upper Main, round which
  their possessions centred. The rivalry between the two families was
  intensified by their efforts to extend their authority in the region of
  the middle Main, and this quarrel, known as the "Babenberg feud," came to
  a head at the beginning of the 10th century during the <!-- Page 92
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[v.03
  p.0092]</span>troubled reign of the German king, Louis the Child. Two of
  the Babenberg brothers were killed, and the survivor Adalbert was
  summoned before the imperial court by the regent Hatto I., archbishop of
  Mainz, a partisan of the Conradines. He refused to appear, held his own
  for a time in his castle at Theres against the king's forces, but
  surrendered in 906, and in spite of a promise of safe-conduct was
  beheaded. From this time the Babenbergs lost their influence in
  Franconia; but in 976 Leopold, a member of the family who was a count in
  the Donnegau, is described as margrave of the East Mark, a district not
  more than 60 m. in breadth on the eastern frontier of Bavaria which grew
  into the duchy of Austria. Leopold, who probably received the mark as a
  reward for his fidelity to the emperor Otto II. during the Bavarian
  rising in 976, extended its area at the expense of the Hungarians, and
  was succeeded in 994 by his son Henry I. Henry, who continued his
  father's policy, was followed in 1018 by his brother Adalbert and in 1055
  by his nephew Ernest, whose marked loyalty to the emperors Henry III. and
  Henry IV. was rewarded by many tokens of favour. The succeeding margrave,
  Leopold II., quarrelled with Henry IV., who was unable to oust him from
  the mark or to prevent the succession of his son Leopold III. in 1096.
  Leopold supported Henry, son of Henry IV., in his rising against his
  father, but was soon drawn over to the emperor's side, and in 1106
  married his daughter Agnes, widow of Frederick I., duke of Swabia. He
  declined the imperial crown in 1125. His zeal in founding monasteries
  earned for him his surname "the Pious," and canonization by Pope Innocent
  VIII. in 1485. He is regarded as the patron saint of Austria. One of
  Leopold's sons was Otto, bishop of Freising (<i>q.v.</i>). His eldest
  son, Leopold IV., became margrave in 1136, and in 1139 received from the
  German king Conrad III. the duchy of Bavaria, which had been forfeited by
  Duke Henry the Proud. Leopold's brother Henry (surnamed Jasomirgott from
  his favourite oath, "So help me God!") was made count palatine of the
  Rhine in 1140, and became margrave of Austria on Leopold's death in 1141.
  Having married Gertrude, the widow of Henry the Proud, he was invested in
  1143 with the duchy of Bavaria, and resigned his office as count
  palatine. In 1147 he went on crusade, and after his return renounced
  Bavaria at the instance of the new king Frederick I. As compensation for
  this, Austria, the capital of which had been transferred to Vienna in
  1146, was erected into a duchy. The second duke was Henry's son Leopold
  I., who succeeded him in 1177 and took part in the crusades of 1182 and
  1190. In Palestine he quarrelled with Richard I., king of England,
  captured him on his homeward journey and handed him over to the emperor
  Henry VI. Leopold increased the territories of the Babenbergs by
  acquiring Styria in 1192 under the will of his kinsman Duke Ottakar IV.
  He died in 1194, and Austria fell to one son, Frederick, and Styria to
  another, Leopold; but on Frederick's death in 1198 they were again united
  by Duke Leopold II., surnamed "the Glorious." The new duke fought against
  the infidel in Spain, Egypt and Palestine, but is more celebrated as a
  lawgiver, a patron of letters and a founder of towns. Under him Vienna
  became the centre of culture in Germany and the great school of
  Minnesingers (<i>q.v.</i>). His later years were spent in strife with his
  son Frederick, and he died in 1230 at San Germano, whither he had gone to
  arrange the peace between the emperor Frederick II. and Pope Gregory IX.
  His son Frederick II. followed as duke, and earned the name of
  "Quarrelsome" by constant struggles with the kings of Hungary and Bohemia
  and with the emperor. He deprived his mother and sisters of their
  possessions, was hated by his subjects on account of his oppressions, and
  in 1236 was placed under the imperial ban and driven from Austria.
  Restored when the emperor was excommunicated, he treated in vain with
  Frederick for the erection of Austria into a kingdom. He was killed in
  battle in 1246, when the male line of the Babenbergs became extinct. The
  city of Bamberg grew up around the ancestral castle of the family.</p>

  <p><b>BABER,</b> or <span class="sc">Babar</span> (1483-1530), a famous
  conqueror of India and founder of the so-called Mogul dynasty. His name
  was Zahir ud-din-Mahomet, and he was given the surname of Baber, meaning
  the tiger. Born on the 14th of February 1483, he was a descendant of
  Timur, and his father, Omar Sheik, was king of Ferghana, a district of
  what is now Russian Turkestan. Omar died in 1495, and Baber, though only
  twelve years of age, succeeded to the throne. An attempt made by his
  uncles to dislodge him proved unsuccessful, and no sooner was the young
  sovereign firmly settled than he began to meditate an extension of his
  own dominions. In 1497 he attacked and gained possession of Samarkand, to
  which he always seems to have thought he had a natural and hereditary
  right. A rebellion among his nobles robbed him of his native kingdom, and
  while marching to recover it his troops deserted him, and he lost
  Samarkand also. After some reverses he regained both these places, but in
  1501 his most formidable enemy, Shaibani (Sheibani) Khan, ruler of the
  Uzbegs, defeated him in a great engagement and drove him from Samarkand.
  For three years he wandered about trying in vain to recover his lost
  possessions; at last, in 1504, he gathered some troops, and crossing the
  snowy Hindu Kush besieged and captured the strong city of Kabul. By this
  dexterous stroke he gained a new and wealthy kingdom, and completely
  re-established his fortunes. In the following year he united with Hussain
  Mirza of Herat against Shaibani. The death of Hussain put a stop to this
  expedition, but Baber spent a year at Herat, enjoying the pleasures of
  that capital. He returned to Kabul in time to quell a formidable
  rebellion, but two years later a revolt among some of the leading Moguls
  drove him from his city. He was compelled to take to flight with very few
  companions, but his great personal courage and daring struck the army of
  his opponents with such dismay that they again returned to their
  allegiance and Baber regained his kingdom. Once again, in 1510, after the
  death of Shaibani, he endeavoured to obtain possession of his native
  country. He received considerable aid from Shah Ismael of Persia, and in
  1511 made a triumphal entry into Samarkand. But in 1514 he was utterly
  defeated by the Uzbegs and with difficulty reached Kabul. He seems now to
  have resigned all hopes of recovering Ferghana, and as he at the same
  time dreaded an invasion of the Uzbegs from the west, his attention was
  more and more drawn towards India. Several preliminary incursions had
  been already made, when in 1521 an opportunity presented itself for a
  more extended expedition. Ibrahim, emperor of Delhi, had made himself
  detested, even by his Afghan nobles, several of whom called upon Baber
  for assistance. He at once assembled his forces, 12,000 strong, with some
  pieces of artillery and marched into India. Ibrahim, with 100,000
  soldiers and numerous elephants, advanced against him. The great battle
  was fought at Panipat on the 21st of April 1526, when Ibrahim was slain
  and his army routed. Baber at once took possession of Agra. A still more
  formidable enemy awaited him; the Rana Sanga of Mewar collected the
  enormous force of 210,000 men, with which he moved against the invaders.
  On all sides there was danger and revolt, even Baber's own soldiers, worn
  out with the heat of this new climate, longed for Kabul. By vigorous
  measures and inspiriting speeches he restored their courage, though his
  own heart was nearly failing him, and in his distress he abjured the use
  of wine, to which he had been addicted. At Kanwaha, on the 10th of March
  1527, he won a great victory and made himself absolute master of northern
  India. The remaining years of his life he spent in arranging the affairs
  and revenues of his new empire and in improving his capital, Agra. He
  died on the 26th of December 1530 in his forty-eighth year. Baber was
  above the middle height, of great strength and an admirable archer and
  swordsman. His mind was as well cultivated as his bodily powers; he wrote
  well, and his observations are generally acute and accurate; he was
  brave, kindly and generous.</p>

  <p>Full materials for his life are found in his <i>Memoirs</i>, written
  by himself (translated into English by Leyden and Erskine (London, 1826);
  abridged in Caldecott, <i>Life of Baber</i> (London, 1844). See also

  <p><b>BABEUF, FRANÇOIS NOEL</b> (1760-1797), known as <span
  class="sc">Gracchus Babeuf</span>, French political agitator and
  journalist, was born at Saint Quentin on the 23rd of November 1760. His
  father, Claude Babeuf, had deserted the French army in 1738 and taken
  service under Maria Theresa, rising, it is said, to the rank of major.
  Amnestied in 1755 he returned to France, but soon sank into dire poverty,
  being forced to earn a pittance for his wife and family as a day
  labourer. The hardships endured by Babeuf during early years do much to
  explain his later opinions. He had received from his father the
  smatterings of a liberal education, but until the outbreak of the
  Revolution he was a domestic servant, and from 1785 occupied the
  invidious office of <i>commissaire à terrier</i>, his function being to
  assist the nobles and priests in the assertion of their feudal rights as
  against the unfortunate peasants. On the eve of the Revolution Babeuf was
  in the employ of a land surveyor at Roye. His father had died in 1780,
  and he was now the sole support, not only of his wife and two children,
  but of his mother, brothers and sisters. In the circumstances it is not
  surprising that he was the life and soul of the malcontents of the place.
  He was an indefatigable writer, and the first germ of his future
  socialism is contained in a letter of the 21st of March 1787, one of a
  series&mdash;mainly on literature&mdash;addressed to the secretary of the
  Academy of Arras. In 1789 he drew up the first article of the
  <i>cahier</i> of the electors of the <i>bailliage</i> of Roye, demanding
  the abolition of feudal rights. Then, from July to October, he was in
  Paris superintending the publication of his first work: <i>Cadastre
  perpétuel, dédié à l'assemblée nationale, l'an 1789 et le premier de la
  liberté française</i>, which was written in 1787 and issued in 1790. The
  same year he published a pamphlet against feudal aids and the
  <i>gabelle</i>, for which he was denounced and arrested, but
  provisionally released. In October, on his return to Roye, he founded the
  <i>Correspondant picard</i>, the violent character of which cost him
  another arrest. In November he was elected a member of the municipality
  of Roye, but was expelled. In March 1791 he was appointed commissioner to
  report on the national property (<i>biens nationaux</i>) in the town, and
  in September 1792 was elected a member of the council-general of the
  department of the Somme. Here, as everywhere, the violence of his
  attitude made his position intolerable to himself and others, and he was
  soon transferred to the post of administrator of the district of
  Montdidier. Here he was accused of fraud for having substituted one name
  for another in a deed of transfer of national lands. It is probable that
  his fault was one of negligence only; but, distrusting the impartiality
  of the judges of the Somme, he fled to Paris, and on the 23rd of August
  1793 was condemned <i>in contumaciam</i> to twenty years' imprisonment.
  Meanwhile he had been appointed secretary to the relief committee
  (<i>comité des subsistances</i>) of the commune of Paris. The judges of
  Amiens, however, pursued him with a warrant for his arrest, which took
  place in Brumaire of the year II. (1794). The court of cassation quashed
  the sentence, through defect of form, but sent Babeuf for a new trial
  before the Aisne tribunal, by which he was acquitted on the 18th of
  July.</p>

  <p>Babeuf now returned to Paris, and on the 3rd of September 1794
  published the first number of his <i>Journal de la liberté de la
  presse</i>, the title of which was altered on the 5th of October to <i>Le
  Tribun du peuple</i>. The execution of Robespierre on the 28th of July
  had ended the Terror, and Babeuf&mdash;now self-styled "Gracchus"
  Babeuf&mdash;defended the men of Thermidor and attacked the fallen
  terrorists with his usual violence. But he also attacked, from the point
  of view of his own socialistic theories, the economic outcome of the
  Revolution. This was an attitude which had few supporters, even in the
  Jacobin club, and in October Babeuf was arrested and sent to prison at
  Arras. Here he came under the influence of certain terrorist prisoners,
  notably of Lebois, editor of the <i>Journal de l'égalité</i>, afterwards
  of the <i>Ami du peuple</i>, papers which carried on the traditions of
  Marat. He emerged from prison a confirmed terrorist and convinced that
  his Utopia, fully proclaimed to the world in No. 33 of his <i>Tribun</i>,
  could only be realized through the restoration of the constitution of
  1793. He was now in open conflict with the whole trend of public opinion.
  In February 1795 he was again arrested, and the <i>Tribun du peuple</i>
  was solemnly burnt in the Théâtre des Bergères by the <i>jeunesse
  dorée</i>, the young men whose mission it was to bludgeon Jacobinism out
  of the streets and cafés. But for the appalling economic conditions
  produced by the fall in the value of <i>assignats</i>, Babeuf might have
  shared the fate of other agitators who were whipped into obscurity.</p>

  <p>It was the attempts of the Directory to deal with this economic crisis
  that gave Babeuf his real historic importance. The new government was
  pledged to abolish the vicious system by which Paris was fed at the
  expense of all France, and the cessation of the distribution of bread and
  meat at nominal prices was fixed for the 20th of February 1796. The
  announcement caused the most wide-spread consternation. Not only the
  workmen and the large class of idlers attracted to Paris by the system,
  but <i>rentiers</i> and government officials, whose incomes were paid in
  <i>assignats</i> on a scale arbitrarily fixed by the government, saw
  themselves threatened with actual starvation. The government yielded to
  the outcry that arose; but the expedients by which it sought to mitigate
  the evil, notably the division of those entitled to relief into classes,
  only increased the alarm and the discontent. The universal misery gave
  point to the virulent attacks of Babeuf on the existing order, and at
  last gained him a hearing. He gathered round him a small circle of his
  immediate followers known as the <i>Société des Égaux</i>, soon merged
  with the rump of the Jacobins, who met at the Pantheon; and in November
  1795 he was reported by the police to be openly preaching "insurrection,
  revolt and the constitution of 1793."</p>

  <p>For a time the government, while keeping itself informed of his
  activities, left him alone; for it suited the Directory to let the
  socialist agitation continue, in order to frighten the people from
  joining in any royalist movement for the overthrow of the existing
  regime. Moreover the mass of the <i>ouvriers</i>, even of extreme views,
  were repelled by Babeuf's bloodthirstiness; and the police agents
  reported that his agitation was making many converts&mdash;for the
  government. The Jacobin club of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine refused to
  admit Babeuf and Lebois, on the ground that they were "<i>égorgeurs</i>."
  With the development of the economic crisis, however, Babeuf's influence
  increased. After the club of the Pantheon was closed by Bonaparte, on the
  27th of February 1796, his aggressive activity redoubled. In Ventôse and
  Germinal he published, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Lalande, soldat
  de la patrie," a new paper, the <i>Éclaireur du peuple, ou le défenseur
  de vingt-cinq millions d'opprimés</i>, which was hawked clandestinely
  from group to group in the streets of Paris. At the same time No. 40 of
  the <i>Tribun</i> excited an immense sensation. In this he praised the
  authors of the September massacres as "deserving well of their country,"
  and declared that a more complete "September 2nd" was needed to
  annihilate the actual government, which consisted of "starvers,
  bloodsuckers, tyrants, hangmen, rogues and mountebanks." The distress
  among all classes continued to be appalling; and in March the attempt of
  the Directory to replace the <i>assignats</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) by a new
  issue of <i>mandats</i> created fresh dissatisfaction after the breakdown
  of the hopes first raised. A cry went up that national bankruptcy had
  been declared, and thousands of the lower class of <i>ouvrier</i> began
  to rally to Babeuf's flag. On the 4th of April it was reported to the
  government that 500,000 people in Paris were in need of relief. From the
  11th Paris was placarded with posters headed <i>Analyse de la doctrine de
  Bab&oelig;uf</i> (sic), <i>tribun du peuple</i>, of which the opening
  sentence ran: "Nature has given to every man the right to the enjoyment
  of an equal share in all property," and which ended with a call to
  restore the constitution of 1793. Babeuf's song <i>Mourant de faim,
  mourant de froid</i> (Dying of hunger, dying of cold), set to a popular
  air, began to be sung in the cafés, with immense applause; and reports
  were current that the disaffected troops in the camp of Grenelle were
  ready to join an <i>émeute</i> against the government. The Directory
  thought it time to act; the <i>bureau central</i> had accumulated through
  its agents, notably the ex-captain Georges <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[v.03 p.0094]</span>Grisel, who had
  been initiated into Babeuf's society, complete evidence of a conspiracy
  for an armed rising fixed for Floréal 22, year IV. (11th of May 1796), in
  which Jacobins and socialists were combined. On the 10th of May Babeuf
  was arrested with many of his associates, among whom were A. Darthé and
  P.&nbsp;M. Buonarroti, the ex-members of the Convention, Robert Lindet,
  J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B. Amar, M.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A. Vadier and Jean Baptiste Drouet, famous as the
  postmaster of Saint-Menehould who had arrested Louis XVI., and now a
  member of the Council of Five Hundred.</p>

  <p>The <i>coup</i> was perfectly successful. The last number of the
  <i>Tribun</i> appeared on the 24th of April, but Lebois in the <i>Ami du
  peuple</i> tried to incite the soldiers to revolt, and for a while there
  were rumours of a military rising. The trial of Babeuf and his
  accomplices was fixed to take place before the newly constituted high
  court of justice at Vendôme. On Fructidor 10 and 11 (27th and 28th of
  August), when the prisoners were removed from Paris, there were tentative
  efforts at a riot with a view to rescue, but these were easily
  suppressed. The attempt of five or six hundred Jacobins (7th of
  September) to rouse the soldiers at Grenelle met with no better success.
  The trial of Babeuf and the others, begun at Vendôme on the 20th of
  February 1797, lasted two months. The government for reasons of their own
  made the socialist Babeuf the leader of the conspiracy, though more
  important people than he were implicated; and his own vanity played
  admirably into their hands. On Prairial 7 (26th of April 1797) Babeuf and
  Darthé were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including
  Buonarroti, were exiled; the rest, including Vadier and his
  fellow-conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet had succeeded in making his
  escape, according to Barras, with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf
  and Darthé were executed at Vendôme on Prairial 8 (1797).</p>

  <p>Babeuf's character has perhaps been sufficiently indicated above. He
  was a type of the French revolutionists, excitable, warm-hearted,
  half-educated, who lost their mental and moral balance in the chaos of
  the revolutionary period. Historically, his importance lies in the fact
  that he was the first to propound socialism as a practical policy, and
  the father of the movements which played so conspicuous a part in the
  revolutions of 1848 and 1871.</p>

  <p><b>BÁBÍISM,</b> the religion founded in Persia in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1844-1845 by Mírzá &#x201B;Alí Muhammad of
  Shíráz, a young Sayyid who was at that time not twenty-five years of age.
  Before his "manifestation" (<i>zuhúr</i>), of which he gives in the
  Persian <i>Bayán</i> a date corresponding to 23rd May 1844, he was a
  disciple of Sayyid Kázim of Rasht, the leader of the Shaykhís, a sect of
  extreme Shí&#x201B;ites characterized by the doctrine (called by them
  <i>Rukn-i-rábi&#x201B;</i>, "the fourth support") that at all times there
  must exist an intermediary between the twelfth Imám and his faithful
  followers. This intermediary they called "the perfect Shí&#x201B;ite,"
  and his prototype is to be found in the four successive <i>Bábs</i> or
  "gates" through whom alone the twelfth Imám, during the period of his
  "minor occultation" (<i>Ghaybat-i-sughrá</i>, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 874-940), held communication with his partisans.
  It was in this sense, and not, as has been often asserted, in the sense
  of "Gate of God" or "Gate of Religion," that the title <i>Báb</i> was
  understood and assumed by Mírzá &#x201B;Alí Muhammad; but, though still
  generally thus styled by non-Bábís, he soon assumed the higher title of
  <i>Nuqta</i> ("Point"), and the title <i>Báb</i>, thus left vacant, was
  conferred on his ardent disciple, Mullá Husayn of Bushrawayh.</p>

  <p>The history of the Bábís, though covering a comparatively short
  period, is so full of incident and the particulars now available are so
  numerous, that the following account purports to be only the briefest
  sketch. The Báb himself was in captivity first at Shíráz, then at Mákú,
  and lastly at Chihríq, during the greater part of the six years (May 1844
  until July 1850) of his brief career, but an active propaganda was
  carried on by his disciples, which resulted in several serious revolts
  against the government, especially after the death of Muhammad Sháh in
  September 1848. Of these risings the first (December 1848-July 1849) took
  place in Mázandarán, at the ruined shrine of Shaykh Tabarsí, near
  Bárfurúsh, where the Bábís, led by Mullá Muhammad &#x201B;Alí of
  Bárfurúsh and Mullá Husayn of Bushrawayh ("the first who believed"),
  defied the shah's troops for seven months before they were finally
  subdued and put to death. The revolt at Zanján in the north-west of
  Persia, headed by Mullá Muhammad &#x201B;Ali Zanjání, also lasted seven
  or eight months (May-December 1850), while a serious but less protracted
  struggle was waged against the government at Níríz in Fárs by Agá Sayyid
  Yahyá of Níríz. Both revolts were in progress when the Báb, with one of
  his devoted disciples, was brought from his prison at Chihríq to Tabríz
  and publicly shot in front of the <i>arg</i> or citadel. The body, after
  being exposed for some days, was recovered by the Bábís and conveyed to a
  shrine near Tehrán, whence it was ultimately removed to Acre in Syria,
  where it is now buried. For the next two years comparatively little was
  heard of the Bábís, but on the 15th of August 1852 three of them, acting
  on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate Násiru'd-Dín Sháh as he
  was returning from the chase to his palace at Niyávarán. The attempt
  failed, but was the cause of a fresh persecution, and on the 31st of
  August 1852 some thirty Bábís, including the beautiful and talented
  poetess Qurratu'l-'Ayn, were put to death in Tehrán with atrocious
  cruelty. Another of the victims of that day was Hájji Mírzá Jání of
  Káshán, the author of the oldest history of the movement from the Bábí
  point of view. Only one complete MS. of his invaluable work (obtained by
  Count Gobineau in Persia) exists in any public library, the Bibliothèque
  Nationale at Paris. The so-called "New History" (of which an English
  translation was published at Cambridge in 1893 by E.&nbsp;G. Browne) is based
  on Mírzá Jání's work, but many important passages which did not accord
  with later Bábí doctrine or policy have been suppressed or modified,
  while some additions have been made. The Báb was succeeded on his death
  by Mírzá Yahyá of Núr (at that time only about twenty years of age), who
  escaped to Bagdad, and, under the title of <i>Subh-i-Ezel</i> ("the
  Morning of Eternity"), became the pontiff of the sect. He lived, however,
  in great seclusion, leaving the direction of affairs almost entirely in
  the hands of his elder half-brother (born 12th November 1817), Mírzá
  Husayn &#x201B;Alí, entitled <i>Bahá' u'lláh</i> ("the Splendour of
  God"), who thus gradually became the most conspicuous and most
  influential member of the sect, though in the <i>Iqán</i>, one of the
  most important polemical works of the Bábís, composed in 1858-1859, he
  still implicitly recognized the supremacy of <i>Subh-i-Ezel</i>. In 1863,
  however, Bahá declared himself to be "He whom God shall manifest" (<i>Man
  Yuz-hiruhu'lláh</i>, with prophecies of whose advent the works of the Báb
  are filled), and called on all the Bábís to recognize his claim. The
  majority responded, but <i>Subh-i-Ezel</i> and some of his faithful
  adherents refused. After that date the Bábís divided into two sects,
  Ezelís and Bahá'ís, of which the former steadily lost and the latter
  gained ground, so that in 1908 there were probably from half a million to
  a million of the latter, and at most only a hundred or two of the former.
  In 1863 the Bábís were, at the instance of the Persian government,
  removed from Bagdad to Constantinople, whence they were shortly
  afterwards transferred to Adrianople. In 1868 Bahá and his followers were
  exiled to Acre in Syria, and <i>Subh-i-Ezel</i> with his few adherents to
  Famagusta in Cyprus, where he was still living in 1908. Bahá'u'lláh died
  at Acre on the 16th of May 1892. His son &#x201B;Abbás Efendí (also
  called &#x201B;Abdu'l-Bahá, "the servant of Bahá") was generally
  recognized as his successor, but another of his four sons, Muhammad
  &#x201B;Alí, put forward a rival claim. This caused a fresh and bitter
  schism, but &#x201B;Abbás Efendí steadily gained ground, and there could
  be little doubt as to his eventual <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[v.03 p.0095]</span>triumph. The
  controversial literature connected with this latest schism is abundant,
  not only in Persian, but in English, for since 1900 many Americans have
  adopted the religion of Bahá. The original apostle of America was Ibráhím
  George Khayru'lláh, who began his propaganda at the Chicago Exhibition
  and later supported the claims of Muhammad &#x201B;Alí. Several Persian
  missionaries, including the aged and learned Mírzá Abu'l-Fazl of
  Gulpáyagán, were thereupon despatched to America by &#x201B;Abbás Efendí,
  who was generally accepted by the American Bahá'ís as "the Master." The
  American press contained many notices of the propaganda and its success.
  An interesting article on the subject, by Stoyan Krstoff Vatralsky of
  Boston, Mass., entitled "Mohammedan Gnosticism in America," appeared in
  the <i>American Journal of Theology</i> for January 1902, pp. 57-58.</p>

  <p>A correct understanding of the doctrines of the early Bábís (now
  represented by the Ezelís) is hardly possible save to one who is
  conversant with the theology of Islám and its developments, and
  especially the tenets of the Shí&#x201B;a. The Bábís are Muhammadans only
  in the sense that the Muhammadans are Christians or the Christians Jews;
  that is to say, they recognize Muhammad (Mahomet) as a true prophet and
  the Qur'án (Koran) as a revelation, but deny their finality. Revelation,
  according to their view, is progressive, and no revelation is final, for,
  as the human race progresses, a fuller measure of truth, and ordinances
  more suitable to the age, are vouchsafed. The Divine Unity is
  incomprehensible, and can be known only through its Manifestations; to
  recognize the Manifestation of the cycle in which he lives is the supreme
  duty of man. Owing to the enormous volume and unsystematic character of
  the Bábí scriptures, and the absence of anything resembling church
  councils, the doctrine on many important points (such as the future life)
  is undetermined and vague. The resurrection of the body is denied, but
  some form of personal immortality is generally, though not universally,
  accepted. Great importance was attached to the mystical values of letters
  and numbers, especially the numbers 18 and 19 ("the number of the unity")
  and 19² = 361 ("the number of all things"). In general, the Báb's
  doctrines most closely resembled those of the Isma&#x201B;ílís and
  Hurúfís. In the hands of Bahá the aims of the sect became much more
  practical and ethical, and the wilder pantheistic tendencies and
  metaphysical hair-splittings of the early Bábís almost disappeared. The
  intelligence, integrity and morality of the Bábís are high, but their
  efforts to improve the social position of woman have been much
  exaggerated. They were in no way concerned (as was at the time falsely
  alleged) in the assassination of Násiru'd-Dín Sháh in May 1896. Of recent
  persecutions of the sect the two most notable took place at Yazd, one in
  May 1891, and another of greater ferocity in June 1903. Some account of
  the latter is given by Napier Malcolm in his book <i>Five Years in a
  Persian Town</i> (London, 1905), pp. 87-89 and 186. In the constitutional
  movement in Persia (1907) the Bábís, though their sympathies are
  undoubtedly with the reformers, wisely refrained from outwardly
  identifying themselves with that party, to whom their open support, by
  alienating the orthodox <i>mujtahids</i> and <i>mullás</i>, would have
  proved fatal. Here, as in all their actions, they clearly obeyed orders
  issued from headquarters.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;The literature of the sect
  is very voluminous, but mostly in manuscript. The most valuable public
  collections in Europe are at St Petersburg, London (British Museum) and
  Paris (Bibliothèque Nationale), where two or three very rare MSS.
  collected by Gobineau, including the precious history of the Báb's
  contemporary, Hájji Mírzá Jání of Káshán, are preserved. For the
  bibliography up to 1889, see vol. ii. pp. 173-211 of the <i>Traveller's
  Narrative, written to illustrate the Episode of the Báb</i>, a Persian
  work composed by Bahá's son, &#x201B;Abbás Efendí, edited, translated and
  annotated by E.&nbsp;G. Browne (Cambridge, 1891). More recent works
  are:&mdash;Browne, <i>The New History of the Báb</i> (Cambridge, 1893);
  and "Catalogue and Description of the 27 Bábí Manuscripts," <i>Journal of
  R. Asiat. Soc.</i> (July and October 1892); Andreas, <i>Die Bábí's in
  Persien</i> (1896); Baron Victor Rosen, <i>Collections scientifiques de
  l'Institut des Langues orientales</i>, vol. i. (1877), pp. 179-212; vol.
  iii. (1886), pp. 1-51; vol. vi. (1891), pp. 141-255; "Manuscrits Bâbys";
  and other important articles in Russian by the same scholar; and by
  Captain A.&nbsp;G. Toumansky in the <i>Zapiski vostochnava otdyèleniya
  Imperatorskava Russkava Archeologicheskava Obshchestva</i> (vols.
  iv.-xii., St Petersburg, 1890-1900); also an excellent edition by
  Toumansky, with Russian translation, notes and introduction, of the
  <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i> (the most important of Bahá's works), &amp;c. (St
  Petersburg, 1899). Mention should also be made of an Arabic history of
  the Bábís (unsympathetic but well-informed) written by a Persian, Mírzá
  Muhammad Mahdí Khan, <i>Za&#x201B;imu'd-Duwla</i>, printed in Cairo in
  <span class="scac">A.H.</span> 1321 (= <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1903-1904). Of the works composed in English for the American converts
  the most important are:&mdash;<i>Bahá'u'lláh</i> (The Glory of God), by
  Ibráhím Khayru'lláh, assisted by Howard MacNutt (Chicago, 1900); <i>The
  Three Questions</i> (n.d.) and <i>Facts for Baháists</i> (1901), by the
  same; <i>Life and Teachings of &#x201B;Abbás Efendí</i>, by Myron H.
  Phelps, with preface by E.&nbsp;G. Browne (New York, 1903); Isabella
  Brittingham, <i>The Revelations of Bahá'u'lláh, in a Sequence of Four
  Lessons</i> (1902); Laura Clifford Burney, <i>Some Answered Questions
  Collected</i> [in Acre, 1904-1906] <i>and Translated from the Persian of
  &#x201B;Abdu'l-Bahá</i> [<i>i.e.</i> &#x201B;Abbás Efendí] (London,
  1908). In French, A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;M. Nicolas (first dragoman at the French legation
  at Tehrán) has published several important translations, viz. <i>Le Livre
  des sept preuves de la mission du Báb</i> (Paris, 1902); <i>Le Livre de
  la certitude</i> (1904); and <i>Le Beyân arabe</i> (1905); and there are
  other notable works by H. Dreyfus, an adherent of the Bábí faith. Lastly,
  mention should be made of a remarkable but scarce little tract by Gabriel
  Sacy, printed at Cairo in June 1902, and entitled <i>Du règne de Dieu et
  de l'Agneau, connu sous le nom de Babysme</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BABINGTON, ANTHONY</b> (1561-1586), English conspirator, son of
  Henry Babington of Dethick in Derbyshire, and of Mary, daughter of
  George, Lord Darcy, was born in October 1561, and was brought up secretly
  a Roman Catholic. As a youth he served at Sheffield as page to Mary queen
  of Scots, for whom he early felt an ardent devotion. In 1580 he came to
  London, attended the court of Elizabeth, and joined the secret society
  formed that year supporting the Jesuit missionaries. In 1582 after the
  execution of Father Campion he withdrew to Dethick, and attaining his
  majority occupied himself for a short time with the management of his
  estates. Later he went abroad and became associated at Paris with Mary's
  supporters who were planning her release with the help of Spain, and on
  his return he was entrusted with letters for her. In April 1586 he
  became, with the priest John Ballard, leader of a plot to murder
  Elizabeth and her ministers, and organize a general Roman Catholic rising
  in England and liberate Mary. The conspiracy was regarded by Mendoza, the
  Spanish ambassador, one of its chief instigators, and also by Walsingham,
  as the most dangerous of recent years; it included, in its general
  purpose of destroying the government, a large number of Roman Catholics,
  and had ramifications all over the country. Philip II. of Spain, who
  ardently desired the success of an enterprise "so Christian, just and
  advantageous to the holy Catholic faith,"<a name="FnAnchor_071"
  href="#Footnote_071"><sup>[1]</sup></a> promised to assist with an
  expedition directly the assassination of the queen was effected.
  Babington's conduct was marked by open folly and vanity. Desirous of some
  token of appreciation from Mary for his services, he entered into a long
  correspondence with her, which was intercepted by the spies of
  Walsingham. On the 4th of August Ballard was seized and betrayed his
  comrades, probably under torture. Babington then applied for a passport
  abroad, for the ostensible purpose of spying upon the refugees, but in
  reality to organize the foreign expedition and secure his own safety. The
  passport being delayed, he offered to reveal to Walsingham a dangerous
  conspiracy, but the latter sent no reply, and meanwhile the ports were
  closed and none allowed to leave the kingdom for some days. He was still
  allowed his liberty, but one night while supping with Walsingham's
  servant he observed a memorandum of the minister's concerning himself,
  fled to St John's Wood, where he was joined by some of his companions,
  and after disguising himself succeeded in reaching Harrow, where he was
  sheltered by a recent convert to Romanism. Towards the end of August he
  was discovered and imprisoned in the Tower. On the 13th and 14th of
  September he was tried with Ballard and five others by a special
  commission, when he confessed his guilt, but strove to place all the
  blame upon Ballard. All were condemned to death for high treason. On the
  19th he wrote to Elizabeth praying for mercy, and the same day offered
  £1000 for procuring his pardon; and on the 20th, having disclosed the
  cipher used in the correspondence between himself and Mary, he was
  executed <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[v.03
  p.0096]</span>with the usual barbarities in Lincoln's Inn Fields. The
  detection of the plot led to Mary's own destruction. There is no positive
  documentary proof in Mary's own hand that she had knowledge of the
  intended assassination of Elizabeth, but her circumstances, together with
  the tenour of her correspondence with Babington, place her complicity
  beyond all reasonable doubt.</p>

  <p><b>BABINGTON, CHURCHILL</b> (1821-1889), English classical scholar and
  archaeologist, was born at Roecliffe, in Leicestershire, on the 11th of
  March 1821. He was educated by his father till he was seventeen, when he
  was placed under the tuition of Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, the orientalist
  and archaeologist. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1839, and
  graduated B.A. in 1843, being seventh in the first class of the classical
  tripos and a senior optime. In 1845 he obtained the Hulsean Prize for his
  essay <i>The Influence of Christianity in promoting the Abolition of
  Slavery in Europe</i>. In 1846 he was elected to a fellowship and took
  orders. He proceeded to the degree of M.A. in 1846 and D.D. in 1879. From
  1848 to 1861 he was vicar of Horningsea, near Cambridge, and from 1866 to
  his death on the 12th of January 1889, vicar of Cockfield in Suffolk.
  From 1865 to 1880 he held the Disney professorship of archaeology at
  Cambridge. In his lectures, illustrated from his own collections of coins
  and vases, he dealt chiefly with Greek and Roman pottery and
  numismatics.</p>

  <p>Dr Babington was a many-sided man and wrote on a variety of subjects.
  His early familiarity with country life gave him a taste for natural
  history, especially botany and ornithology. He was also an authority on
  conchology. He was the author of the appendices on botany (in part) and
  ornithology in Potter's <i>History and Antiquities of Charnwood
  Forest</i> (1842); <i>Mr Macaulay's Character of the Clergy ...
  considered</i> (1849), a defence of the clergy of the 17th century, which
  received the approval of Mr Gladstone, against the strictures of
  Macaulay. He also brought out the <i>editio princeps</i> of the speeches
  of Hypereides <i>Against Demosthenes</i> (1850), <i>On Behalf of
  Lycophron and Euxenippus</i> (1853), and his <i>Funeral Oration</i>
  (1858). It was by his edition of these speeches from the papyri
  discovered at Thebes (Egypt) in 1847 and 1856 that Babington's fame as a
  Greek scholar was made. In 1855 he published an edition of <i>Benefizio
  della Morte di Cristo</i>, a remarkable book of the Reformation period,
  attributed to Paleario, of which nearly all the copies had been destroyed
  by the Inquisition. Babington's edition was a facsimile of the <i>editio
  princeps</i> published at Venice in 1543, with Introduction and French
  and English versions. He also edited the first two volumes of Higden's
  <i>Polychronicon</i> (1858) and Bishop Pecock's <i>Repressor of Overmuch
  Blaming of the Clergy</i> (1860), undertaken at the request of the Master
  of the Rolls; <i>Introductory Lecture on Archaeology</i> (1865); <i>Roman
  Antiquities found at Rougham</i> [1872]; <i>Catalogue of Birds of
  Suffolk</i> (1884-1886); <i>Flora of Suffolk</i> (with W.&nbsp;M. Hind, 1889),
  and (1855, 1865) some inscriptions found in Crete by T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B. Spratt, the
  explorer of the island. In addition to contributing to various classical
  and scientific journals, he catalogued the classical MSS. in the
  University Library and the Greek and English coins in the Fitzwilliam
  museum.</p>

  especially the last, are smaller and simpler than in the pigs of the
  genus <i>Sus</i>, but the peculiarity of this genus is the extraordinary
  development of the canines, or tusks, of the male. These teeth are
  ever-growing, long, slender and curved, and without enamel. Those of the
  upper jaw are directed upwards from their bases, so that they never enter
  the mouth, but pierce the skin of the face, thus resembling horns rather
  than teeth; they curve backwards, downwards, and finally often forwards
  again, almost or quite touching the forehead. Dr A.&nbsp;R. Wallace remarks
  that "it is difficult to understand what can be the use of these
  horn-like teeth. Some of the old writers supposed that they served as
  hooks by which the creature could rest its head on a branch. But the way
  in which they usually diverge just over and in front of the eye has
  suggested the more probable idea, that they serve to guard these organs
  from thorns and spines while hunting for fallen fruits among the tangled
  thickets of rattans and other spiny plants. Even this, however, is not
  satisfactory, for the female, who must seek her food in the same way,
  does not possess them. I should be inclined to believe rather that these
  tusks were once useful, and were then worn down as fast as they grew, but
  that changed conditions of life have rendered them unnecessary, and they
  now develop into a monstrous form, just as the incisors of the beaver and
  rabbit will go on growing if the opposite teeth do not wear them away. In
  old animals they reach an enormous size, and are generally broken off as
  if by fighting." On this latter view we may regard the tusks of the male
  babirusa as examples of redundant development, analogous to that of the
  single pair of lower teeth in some of the beaked whales. Unlike ordinary
  wild pigs, the babirusa produces uniformly coloured young. (See <span

  <p><b>BABOON</b> (from the Fr. <i>babuin</i>, which is itself derived
  from <i>Babon</i>, the Egyptian deity to whom it was sacred), properly
  the designation of the long-muzzled, medium-tailed Egyptian monkey,
  scientifically known as <i>Papio anubis</i>; in a wider sense applied to
  all the members of the genus <i>Papio</i> (formerly known as
  <i>Cynocephalus</i>) now confined to Africa and Arabia, although in past
  times extending into India. Baboons are for the most part large
  terrestrial monkeys with short or medium-sized tails, and long naked
  dog-like muzzles, in the truncated extremity of which are pierced the
  nostrils. As a rule, they frequent barren rocky districts in large
  droves, and are exceedingly fierce and dangerous to approach. They have
  large cheek-pouches, large naked callosities, often brightly coloured, on
  the buttocks, and short thick limbs, adapted rather to walking than to
  climbing. Their diet includes practically everything eatable they can
  capture or kill. The typical representative of the genus is the yellow
  baboon (<i>P. cynocephalus</i>, or <i>babuin</i>), distinguished by its
  small size and grooved muzzle, and ranging from Abyssinia to the Zambezi.
  The above-mentioned anubis baboon, <i>P. anubis</i> (with the subspecies
  <i>neumanni</i>, <i>pruinosus</i>, <i>heuglini</i> and <i>doguera</i>),
  ranging from Egypt all through tropical Africa, together with <i>P.
  sphinx</i>, <i>P. olivaceus</i>, the Abyssinian <i>P. lydekkeri</i>, and
  the chacma, <i>P. porcarius</i> of the Cape, represent the subgenus
  <i>Choeropithecus</i>. The named Arabian baboon, <i>P. hamadryas</i> of
  North Africa and Arabia, dedicated by the ancient Egyptians to the god
  Thoth, and the South Arabian <i>P. arabicus</i>, typify <i>Hamadryas</i>;
  while the drill and mandrill of the west coast, <i>P. leucophaeus</i> and
  <i>P. maimon</i>, constitute the subgenus <i>Maimon</i>. The anubis
  baboons, as shown by the frescoes, were tamed by the ancient Egyptians
  and trained to pluck sycamore-figs from the trees. (See <span

  <p><b>BABRIUS,</b> author of a collection of fables written in Greek.
  Practically nothing is known of him. He is supposed to have been a Roman,
  whose gentile name was possibly Valerius, living in the East, probably in
  Syria, where the fables seem first <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[v.03 p.0097]</span>to have gained
  popularity. The address to "a son of King Alexander" has caused much
  speculation, with the result that dates varying between the 3rd century
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> and the 3rd century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> have been assigned to Babrius. The Alexander
  referred to may have been Alexander Severus (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 222-235), who was fond of having literary men of
  all kinds about his court. "The son of Alexander" has further been
  identified with a certain Branchus mentioned in the fables, and it is
  suggested that Babrius may have been his tutor; probably, however,
  Branchus is a purely fictitious name. There is no mention of Babrius in
  ancient writers before the beginning of the 3rd century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>, and his language and style seem to show that he
  belonged to that period. The first critic who made Babrius more than a
  mere name was Richard Bentley, in his <i>Dissertation on the Fables of
  Aesop</i>. In a careful examination of these prose Aesopian fables, which
  had been handed down in various collections from the time of Maximus
  Planudes, Bentley discovered traces of versification, and was able to
  extract a number of verses which he assigned to Babrius. Tyrwhitt (<i>De
  Babrio</i>, 1776) followed up the researches of Bentley, and for some
  time the efforts of scholars were directed towards reconstructing the
  metrical original of the prose fables. In 1842 M. Minas, a Greek, the
  discoverer of the <i>Philosophoumena</i> of Hippolytus, came upon a MS.
  of Babrius in the convent of St Laura on Mount Athos, now in the British
  Museum. This MS. contained 123 fables out of the supposed original
  number, 160. They are arranged alphabetically, but break off at the
  letter O. The fables are written in choliambic, <i>i.e.</i> limping or
  imperfect iambic verse, having a spondee as the last foot, a metre
  originally appropriated to satire. The style is extremely good, the
  expression being terse and pointed, the versification correct and
  elegant, and the construction of the stories is fully equal to that in
  the prose versions. The genuineness of this collection of the fables was
  generally admitted by scholars. In 1857 Minas professed to have
  discovered at Mount Athos another MS. containing 94 fables and a preface.
  As the monks refused to sell this MS., he made a copy of it, which was
  sold to the British Museum, and was published in 1859 by Sir G. Cornewall
  Lewis. This, however, was soon proved to be a forgery. Six more fables
  were brought to light by P. Knöll from a Vatican MS. (edited by A.
  Eberhard, <i>Analecta Babriana</i>, 1879).</p>

  <p><b>BABU,</b> a native Indian clerk. The word is really a term of
  respect attached to a proper name, like "master" or "Mr," and
  <i>Babu-ji</i> is still used in many parts of India, meaning "sir"; but
  without the suffix the word itself is now generally used contemptuously
  as signifying a semi-literate native, with a mere veneer of modern
  education.</p>

  <p><b>BABY-FARMING,</b><a name="FnAnchor_081"
  href="#Footnote_081"><sup>[1]</sup></a> a term meaning generally the
  taking in of infants to nurse for payment, but usually with an
  implication of improper treatment. Previous to the year 1871 the abuse of
  the practice of baby-farming in England had grown to an alarming extent,
  while the trials of Margaret Waters and Mary Hall called attention to the
  infamous relations between the lying-in houses and the baby-farming
  houses of London. The evil was, no doubt, largely connected with the
  question of illegitimacy, for there was a wide-spread existence of
  baby-farms where children were received without question on payment of a
  lump sum. Such children were nearly all illegitimate, and in these cases
  it was to the pecuniary advantage of the baby-farmer to hasten the death
  of the child. It had become also the practice for factory operatives and
  mill-hands to place out their children by the day, and since in many
  cases the children were looked upon as a burden and a drain on their
  parents' resources, too particular inquiry was not always made as to the
  mode in which the children were cared for. The form was gone through too
  of paying a ridiculously insufficient sum for the maintenance of the
  child. In 1871 the House of Commons found it necessary to appoint a
  select committee "to inquire as to the best means of preventing the
  destruction of the lives of infants put out to nurse for hire by their
  parents." "Improper and insufficient food," said the committee, "opiates,
  drugs, crowded rooms, bad air, want of cleanliness, and wilful neglect
  are sure to be followed in a few months by diarrhoea, convulsions and
  wasting away." These unfortunate children were nearly all illegitimate,
  and the mere fact of their being hand-nursed, and not breast-nursed, goes
  some way (according to the experience of the Foundling hospital and the
  Magdalene home) to explain the great mortality among them. Such children,
  when nursed by their mothers in the workhouse, generally live. The
  practical result of the committee of 1871 was the act of 1872, which
  provided for the compulsory registration of all houses in which more than
  one child under the age of one year were received for a longer period
  than twenty-four hours. No licence was granted by the justices of the
  peace, unless the house was suitable for the purpose, and its owner a
  person of good character and able to maintain the children. Offences
  against the act, including wilful neglect of the children even in a
  suitable house, were punishable by a fine of £5 or six months'
  imprisonment with or without hard labour. In 1896 a select committee of
  the House of Lords sat and reported on the working of this act. In
  consequence of this report the act of 1872 was repealed and superseded by
  the Infant Life Protection Act 1897, which did away with the system of
  registration and substituted for it one of notice to a supervening
  authority. By the act all persons retaining or receiving for hire more
  than one infant under the age of <i>five</i> had to give written notice
  of the fact to the local authority. The local authorities were empowered
  to appoint inspectors, and required to arrange for the periodical
  inspection of infants so taken in, while they could also fix the number
  of infants which might be retained. By a special clause any person
  receiving an infant under the age of two years for a sum of money not
  exceeding twenty pounds had to give notice of the fact to the local
  authority. If any infants were improperly kept, the inspector might
  obtain an order for their removal to a work-house or place of safety
  until restored to their parents or guardians, or otherwise legally
  disposed of. The act of 1897 was repealed and amended by the Children Act
  1908, which codified the law relating to children, and added many new
  provisions. This act is dealt with in the article <span
  class="sc">Children, Law relating to</span>.</p>

  <p>In the United States the law is noticeably strict in most states. In
  Massachusetts, a law of 1891 directs that "every person who receives for
  board, or for the purpose of procuring adoption, an infant under the age
  of three years shall use diligence to ascertain whether or not such
  infant is illegitimate, and if he knows or has reason to believe it to be
  illegitimate shall forthwith notify the State Board of Charity of the
  fact of such reception; and said board and its officers or agents may
  enter and inspect any building where they may have reason to believe that
  any such illegitimate infant is boarded, and remove such infant when, in
  their judgment, such removal is necessary by reason of neglect, abuse or
  other causes, in order to preserve the infant's life, and such infant so
  removed shall be in the custody of said Board of Charity, which shall
  make provision therefor according to law." The penal code of the state of
  New York requires a licence for baby-farming to be issued by the board of
  health of the city or town where such children are boarded or kept, and
  "every person so licensed must keep a register wherein he shall enter the
  names and ages of all such children, and of all children born on such
  premises, and the names and residences of their parents, as far as known,
  the time of reception and the discharge of such children, and the reasons
  therefor, and also a correct register of every child under five years of
  age who is given out, adopted, taken away, or indentured from such place
  <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>[v.03
  p.0098]</span>to or by any one, together with the name and residence of
  the person so adopting" (Pen. Code, § 288, subsec. 4).</p>

  <p>Persons neglecting children may be prosecuted under § 289 of the N.Y.
  penal code, which provides that any person who "wilfully causes or
  permits the life or limb of any child, actually or apparently under the
  age of sixteen years, to be endangered, or its health to be injured, or
  its morals to become depraved ... is guilty of a misdemeanour."</p>

  <p>In Australia particular care has been taken by most of the states to
  prevent the evils of baby-farming. In South Australia there is a State
  Children's Council, which, under the State Children Act of 1895, has
  large powers with respect to the oversight of infants under two years
  boarded out by their mother. "Foster-mothers," as the women who take in
  infants as boarders are called, must be licensed, while the number of
  children authorized to be kept by the foster-mother is fixed by licence;
  every licensed foster-mother must keep a register containing the name,
  age and place of birth of every child received by her, the names,
  addresses and description of the parents, or of any person other than the
  parents from or to whom the child was received or delivered over, the
  date of receipt or delivery over, particulars of any accident to or
  illness of the child, and the name of the medical practitioner (if any)
  by whom attended. In New South Wales the Children's Protection Act of
  1892, with the amendments of 1902, requires the same state supervision
  over the homes in which children are boarded out, with licensing of
  foster-mothers. In Victoria an act was passed in 1890 for "making better
  provision for the protection of infant life." In New Zealand, there is
  legislation to the same effect by the "Adoption of Children Act 1895" and
  the "Infant Life Protection Act 1896."</p>

  <p><a name="Footnote_081" href="#FnAnchor_081">[1]</a> Baby is a

  scriptural language. "Babe" is probably a form of the earlier

</div>
  <p><b>BABYLON</b> (mod. <i>Hillah</i>), an ancient city on the left bank
  of the Euphrates, about 70 m. S. of Bagdad. "Babylon" is the Greek form
  of Babel or Bab-ili, "the gate of the god" (sometimes incorrectly written
  "of the gods"), which again is the Semitic translation of the original
  Sumerian name Ka-dimirra. The god was probably Merodach or Marduk
  (<i>q.v.</i>), the divine patron of the city. In an inscription of the
  Kassite conqueror Gaddas the name appears as Ba-ba-lam, as if from the
  Assyrian <i>babalu</i>, "to bring"; another foreign
  <i>Volksetymologie</i> is found in Genesis xi. 9, from <i>balbal</i>, "to
  confound." A second name of the city, which perhaps originally denoted a
  separate village or quarter, was Su-anna, and in later inscriptions it is
  often represented ideographically by E-ki, the pronunciation and meaning
  of which are uncertain. One of its oldest names, however, was Din-tir, of
  which the poets were especially fond; Din-tir signifies in Sumerian "the
  life of the forest," though a native lexicon translates it "seat of
  life." Uru-azagga, "the holy city," was also a title sometimes applied to
  Babylon as to other cities in Babylonia. Ka-dimirra, the Semitic Bab-ili,
  probably denoted at first E-Saggila, "the house of the lofty head," the
  temple dedicated to Bel-Merodach, along with its immediate surroundings.
  Like the other great sanctuaries of Babylonia the temple had been founded
  in pre-Semitic times, and the future Babylon grew up around it. Since
  Merodach was the son of Ea, the culture god of Eridu near Ur on the
  Persian Gulf, it is possible that Babylon was a colony of Eridu.
  Adjoining Babylon was a town called Borsippa (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

  <p>The earliest mention of Babylon is in a dated tablet of the reign of
  Sargon of Akkad (3800 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), who is stated to
  have built sanctuaries there to Anunit and A&#x113; (or Ea), and H.
  Winckler may be right in restoring a mutilated passage in the annals of
  this king so as to make it mean that Babylon owed its name to Sargon, who
  made it the capital of his empire. If so, it fell back afterwards into
  the position of a mere provincial town and remained so for centuries,
  until it became the capital of "the first dynasty of Babylon" and then of
  Khammurabi's empire (2250 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>). From this time
  onward it continued to be the capital of Babylonia and the holy city of
  western Asia. The claim to supremacy in Asia, however real in fact, was
  not admitted <i>de jure</i> until the claimant had "taken the hands" of
  Bel-Merodach at Babylon, and thereby been accepted as his adopted son and
  the inheritor of the old Babylonian empire. It was this which made
  Tiglath-pileser III. and other Assyrian kings so anxious to possess
  themselves of Babylon and so to legitimize their power. Sennacherib alone
  seems to have failed in securing the support of the Babylonian
  priesthood; at all events he never underwent the ceremony, and Babylonia
  throughout his reign was in a constant state of revolt which was finally
  suppressed only by the complete destruction of the capital. In 689 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> its walls, temples and palaces were razed to the
  ground and the rubbish thrown into the Arakhtu, the canal which bordered
  the earlier Babylon on the south. The act shocked the religious
  conscience of western Asia; the subsequent murder of Sennacherib was held
  to be an expiation of it, and his successor Esar-haddon hastened to
  rebuild the old city, to receive there his crown, and make it his
  residence during part of the year. On his death Babylonia was left to his
  elder son Samas-sum-yukin, who eventually headed a revolt against his
  brother Assur-bani-pal of Assyria. Once more Babylon was besieged by the
  Assyrians and starved into surrender. Assur-bani-pal purified the city
  and celebrated a "service of reconciliation," but did not venture to
  "take the hands" of Bel. In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian
  empire the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.</p>

  <p>With the recovery of Babylonian independence under Nabopolassar a new
  era of architectural activity set in, and his son Nebuchadrezzar made
  Babylon one of the wonders of the ancient world. It surrendered without a
  struggle to Cyrus, but two sieges in the reign of Darius Hystaspis, and
  one in the reign of Xerxes, brought about the destruction of the
  defences, while the monotheistic rule of Persia allowed the temples to
  fall into decay. Indeed part of the temple of E-Saggila, which like other
  ancient temples served as a fortress, was intentionally pulled down by
  Xerxes after his capture of the city. Alexander was murdered in the
  palace of Nebuchadrezzar, which must therefore have been still standing,
  and cuneiform texts show that, even under the Seleucids, E-Saggila was
  not wholly a ruin. The foundation of Seleucia in its neighbourhood,
  however, drew away the population of the old city and hastened its
  material decay. A tablet dated 275 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> states
  that on the 12th of Nisan the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to
  the new town, where a palace was built as well as a temple to which the
  ancient name of E-Saggila was given. With this event the history of
  Babylon comes practically to an end, though more than a century later we
  find sacrifices being still performed in its old sanctuary.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of its topography is derived from the classical writers,
  the inscriptions of Nebuchadrezzar, and the excavations of the
  <i>Deutsche Orientgesellschaft</i>, which were begun in 1899. The
  topography is necessarily that of the Babylon of Nebuchadrezzar; the
  older Babylon which was destroyed by Sennacherib having left few, if any,
  traces behind. Most of the existing remains lie on the E. bank of the
  Euphrates, the principal being three vast mounds, the <i>Babil</i> to the
  north, the <i>Qasr</i> or "Palace" (also known as the <i>Mujelliba</i>)
  in the centre, and the Ish&#x101;n &#x201B;Amran ibn &#x201B;Ali, with
  the outlying spur of the Jumjuma, to the south. Eastward of these come
  the Ish&#x101;n el-Aswad or "Black Mound" and three lines of rampart, one
  of which encloses the <i>Babil</i> mound on the N. and E. sides, while a
  third forms a triangle with the S.E. angle of the other two. W. of the
  Euphrates are other ramparts and the remains of the ancient Borsippa.</p>

  <p>We learn from Herodotus and Ctesias that the city was built on both
  sides of the river in the form of a square, and enclosed within a double
  row of lofty walls to which Ctesias adds a third. Ctesias makes the
  outermost wall 360 stades (42 m.) in circumference, while according to
  Herodotus it measured 480 stades (56 m.), which would include an area of
  about 200 sq. m. The estimate of Ctesias is essentially the same as that
  of Q. Curtius (v. 1. 26), 368 stades, and Clitarchus (<i>ap.</i> Diod.
  Sic. ii. 7), 365 stades; Strabo (xvi. 1. 5) makes it 385 stades. But even
  the estimate of Ctesias, assuming the stade to be its usual length, would
  imply an area of about 100 sq. m. According to Herodotus the height of
  the walls was about 335 ft. and their width 85 ft; <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[v.03 p.0099]</span>according to
  Ctesias the height was about 300 ft. The measurements seem exaggerated,
  but we must remember that even in Xenophon's time (<i>Anab.</i> iii. 4.
  10) the ruined wall of Nineveh was still 150 ft high, and that the spaces
  between the 250 towers of the wall of Babylon (Ctes. 417, <i>ap.</i>
  Diod. ii. 7) were broad enough to let a four-horse chariot turn (Herod.
  i. 179). The clay dug from the moat served to make the bricks of the
  wall, which had 100 gates, all of bronze, with bronze lintels and posts.
  The two inner enclosures were faced with enamelled tiles and represented
  hunting-scenes. Two other walls ran along the banks of the Euphrates and
  the quays with which it was lined, each containing 25 gates which
  answered to the number of streets they led into. Ferry-boats plied
  between the landing-places of the gates, and a movable drawbridge (30 ft.
  broad), supported on stone piers, joined the two parts of the city
  together.</p>

  <p>The account thus given of the walls must be grossly exaggerated and
  cannot have been that of an eye-witness. Moreover, the two
  walls&mdash;Imgur-Bel, the inner wall, and Nimitti-Bel, the
  outer&mdash;which enclosed the city proper on the site of the older
  Babylon have been confused with the outer ramparts (enclosing the whole
  of Nebuchadrezzar's city), the remains of which can still be traced to
  the east. According to Nebuchadrezzar, Imgur-Bel was built in the form of
  a square, each side of which measured "30 <i>aslu</i> by the great
  cubit"; this would be equivalent, if Professor F. Hommel is right, to
  2400 metres. Four thousand cubits to the east the great rampart was built
  "mountain high," which surrounded both the old and the new town; it was
  provided with a moat, and a reservoir was excavated in the triangle on
  the inner side of its south-east corner, the western wall of which is
  still visible. The Imgur-Bel of Sargon's time has been discovered by the
  German excavators running south of the <i>Qasr</i> from the Euphrates to
  the Gate of Ishtar.</p>

  <p>The German excavations have shown that the <i>Qasr</i> mound
  represents both the old palace of Nabopolassar, and the new palace
  adjoining it built by Nebuchadrezzar, the wall of which he boasts of
  having completed in 15 days. They have also laid bare the site of the
  "Gate of Ishtar" on the east side of the mound and the little temple of
  Nin-Makh (Beltis) beyond it, as well as the raised road for solemn
  processions (<i>A-ibur-sabu</i>) which led from the Gate of Ishtar to
  E-Saggila and skirted the east side of the palace. The road was paved
  with stone and its walls on either side lined with enamelled tiles, on
  which a procession of lions is represented. North of the mound was a
  canal, which seems to have been the Libilkhegal of the inscriptions,
  while on the south side was the Arakhtu, "the river of Babylon," the
  brick quays of which were built by Nabopolassar.</p>

  <p>The site of E-Saggila is still uncertain. The German excavators assign
  it to the &#x201B;Amr&#x101;n mound, its tower having stood in a
  depression immediately to the north of this, and so place it south of the
  <i>Qasr</i>; but E. Lindl and F. Hommel have put forward strong reasons
  for considering it to have been north of the latter, on a part of the
  site which has not yet been explored. A tablet copied by George Smith
  gives us interesting details as to the plan and dimensions of this famous
  temple of Bel; a plan based on these will be found in Hommel's
  <i>Grundriss der Geographie und Geschichte des alten Orients</i>, p. 321.
  There were three courts, the outer or great court, the middle court of
  Ishtar and Zamama, and the inner court on the east side of which was the
  tower of seven stages (known as the House of the Foundation of Heaven and
  Earth), 90 metres high according to Hommel's calculation of the
  measurements in the tablet; while on the west side was the temple proper
  of Merodach and his wife Sarpanit or Zarpanit, as well as chapels of Anu,
  Ea and Bel on either side of it. A winding ascent led to the summit of
  the tower, where there was a chapel, containing, according to Herodotus,
  a couch and golden table (for the showbread) but no image. The golden
  image of Merodach 40 ft. high, stood in the temple below, in the
  sanctuary called E-Kua or "House of the Oracle," together with a table, a
  mercy-seat and an altar&mdash;all of gold. The deities whose chapels were
  erected within the precincts of the temple enclosure were regarded as
  forming his court. Fifty-five of these chapels existed altogether in
  Babylon, but some of them stood independently in other parts of the
  city.</p>

  <p>There are numerous gates in the walls both of E-Saggila and of the
  city, the names of many of which are now known. Nebuchadrezzar says that
  he covered the walls of some of them with blue enamelled tiles "on which
  bulls and dragons were pourtrayed," and that he set up large bulls and
  serpents of bronze on their thresholds.</p>

  <p>The <i>Babil</i> mound probably represents the site of a palace built
  by Nebuchadrezzar at the northern extremity of the city walls and
  attached to a defensive outwork 60 cubits in length. Since H. Rassam
  found remains of irrigation works here it might well be the site of the
  Hanging Gardens. These consisted, we are told, of a garden of trees and
  flowers, built on the topmost of a series of arches some 75 ft. high, and
  in the form of a square, each side of which measured 400 Greek ft. Water
  was raised from the Euphrates by means of a screw (Strabo xvi. 1. 5;
  Diod. ii. 10. 6). In the Jumjuma mound at the southern extremity of the
  old city the contract and other business tablets of the Egibi firm were
  found.</p>

  <p><b>BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA.</b> I.
  <i>Geography.</i>&mdash;Geographically as well as ethnologically and
  historically, the whole district enclosed between the two great rivers of
  western Asia, the Tigris and Euphrates, forms but one country. The
  writers of antiquity clearly recognized this fact, speaking of the whole
  under the general name of Assyria, though Babylonia, as will be seen,
  would have been a more accurate designation. It naturally falls into two
  divisions, the northern being more or less mountainous, while the
  southern is flat and marshy; the near approach of the two rivers to one
  another, at a spot where the undulating plateau of the north sinks
  suddenly into the Babylonian alluvium, tends to separate them still more
  completely. In the earliest times of which we have any record, the
  northern portion was included in Mesopotamia; it was definitely marked
  off as Assyria only after the rise of the Assyrian monarchy. With the
  exception of Assur, the original capital, the chief cities of the
  country, Nineveh, Calah and Arbela, were all on the left bank of the
  Tigris. The reason of this preference for the eastern bank of the Tigris
  was due to its abundant supply of water, whereas the great Mesopotamian
  plain on the western side had to depend upon the streams which flowed
  into the Euphrates. This vast flat, the modern El-Jezireh, is about 250
  miles in length, interrupted only by a single limestone range, rising
  abruptly out of the plain, and branching off from the Zagros mountains
  under the names of <i>Saraz&#x16B;r</i>, <i>Hamrin</i> and <i>Sinjar</i>.
  The numerous remains of old habitations show how thickly this level tract
  must once have been peopled, though now for the most part a wilderness.
  North of the plateau rises a well-watered and undulating belt of country,
  into which run low ranges of limestone hills, sometimes arid, sometimes
  covered with dwarf-oak, and often shutting in, between their northern and
  north-eastern flank and the main mountain-line from which they detach
  themselves, rich plains and fertile valleys. Behind them tower the
  massive ridges of the Niphates and Zagros ranges, where the Tigris and
  Euphrates take their rise, and which cut off Assyria from Armenia and
  Kurdistan.</p>

  <p>The name Assyria itself was derived from that of the city of Assur
  (<i>q.v.</i>) or Asur, now Qal`at Sherqat (Kaleh Shergat), which stood on
  the right bank of the Tigris, midway between the Greater and the Lesser
  Zab. It remained the capital long after the Assyrians had become the
  dominant power in western Asia, but was finally supplanted by Calah
  (<i>Nimr&#x16B;d</i>), Nineveh (<i>Nebi Yunus</i> and <i>Kuyunjik</i>),
  and Dur-Sargina (<i>Khorsabad</i>), some 60 m. farther north (see <span
  class="sc">Nineveh</span>).</p>

  <p>In contrast with the arid plateau of Mesopotamia, stretched the <!--
  Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[v.03
  p.0100]</span>rich alluvial plain of Chaldaea, formed by the deposits of
  the two great rivers by which it was enclosed. The soil was extremely
  fertile, and teemed with an industrious population. Eastward rose the
  mountains of Elam, southward were the sea-marshes and the Kald&#x101; or
  Chaldaeans and other Aramaic tribes, while on the west the civilization
  of Babylonia encroached beyond the banks of the Euphrates, upon the
  territory of the Semitic nomads (or Suti). Here stood Ur (<i>Mugheir</i>,
  more correctly <i>Muqayyar</i>) the earliest capital of the country; and
  Babylon, with its suburb, Borsippa (<i>Birs Nimr&#x16B;d</i>), as well as
  the two Sipparas (the Sepharvaim of Scripture, now <i>Abu Habba</i>),
  occupied both the Arabian and Chaldaean sides of the river (see <span
  class="sc">Babylon</span>). The Arakhtu, or "river of Babylon," flowed
  past the southern side of the city, and to the south-west of it on the
  Arabian bank lay the great inland freshwater sea of <i>Nejef</i>,
  surrounded by red sandstone cliffs of considerable height, 40 m. in
  length and 35 in breadth in the widest part. Above and below this sea,
  from Borsippa to Kufa, extend the famous Chaldaean marshes, where
  Alexander was nearly lost (Arrian, <i>Exp. Al.</i> vii. 22; Strab. xvi.
  1, § 12); but these depend upon the state of the Hindiya canal,
  disappearing altogether when it is closed.</p>

  <p>Eastward of the Euphrates and southward of Sippara, Kutha and Babylon
  were Kis (<i>Uhaimir</i>, 9 m. E. of <i>Hillah</i>), Nippur
  (<i>Niffer</i>)&mdash;where stood the great sanctuary of El-lil, the
  older Bel&mdash;Uruk or Erech (<i>Warka</i>) and Larsa (<i>Senkera</i>)
  with its temple of the sun-god, while eastward of the Shatt el-Hai,
  probably the ancient channel of the Tigris, was Lagash (<i>Tello</i>),
  which played an important part in early Babylonian history. The primitive
  seaport of the country, Eridu, the seat of the worship of Ea the
  culture-god, was a little south of Ur (at <i>Abu Shahrain</i> or
  <i>Now&#x101;wis</i> on the west side of the Euphrates). It is now about
  130 m. distant from the sea; as about 46 m. of land have been formed by
  the silting up of the shore since the foundation of Spasinus Charax
  (<i>Muhamrah</i>) in the time of Alexander the Great, or some 115 ft. a
  year, the city would have been in existence at least 6000 years ago. The
  marshes in the south like the adjoining desert were frequented by Aramaic
  tribes; of these the most famous were the Kald&#x101; or Chaldaeans who
  under Merodach-baladan made themselves masters of Babylon and gave their
  name in later days to the whole population of the country. The combined
  stream of the Euphrates and Tigris as it flowed through the marshes was
  known to the Babylonians as the <i>n&#x101;r marrati</i>, "the salt
  river" (cp. Jer. l. 21), a name originally applied to the Persian
  Gulf.</p>

  <p>The alluvial plain of Babylonia was called Edin, the Eden of Gen. ii.,
  though the name was properly restricted to "the plain" on the western
  bank of the river where the Bedouins pastured the flocks of their
  Babylonian masters. This "bank" or <i>kisad</i>, together with the
  corresponding western bank of the Tigris (according to Hommel the modern
  Shatt el-Hai), gave its name to the land of Chesed, whence the
  <i>Kasdim</i> of the Old Testament. In the early inscriptions of Lagash
  the whole district is known as Gu-Edinna, the Sumerian equivalent of the
  Semitic <i>Kisad Edini</i>. The coast-land was similarly known as
  Gu-&#x101;bba (Semitic <i>Kisad tamtim</i>), the "bank of the sea." A
  more comprehensive name of southern Babylonia was Kengi, "the land," or
  Kengi Sumer, "the land of Sumer," for which Sumer alone came afterwards
  to be used. Sumer has been supposed to be the original of the Biblical
  Shinar; but Shinar represented northern rather than southern Babylonia,
  and was probably the Sankhar of the Tell el-Amarna tablets (but see <span
  class="sc">Sumer</span>). Opposed to Kengi and Sumer were Urra (Uri) and
  Akkad or northern Babylonia. The original meaning of <i>Urra</i> was
  perhaps "clayey soil," but it came to signify "the upper country" or
  "highlands," <i>kengi</i> being "the lowlands." In Semitic times
  <i>Urra</i> was pronounced <i>Uri</i> and confounded with <i>uru</i>,
  "city"; as a geographical term, however, it was replaced by Akkadu
  (Akkad), the Semitic form of Agad&#x113;&mdash;written Akkattim in the
  Elamite inscriptions&mdash;the name of the elder Sargon's capital, which
  must have stood close to Sippara, if indeed it was not a quarter of
  Sippara itself. The rise of Sargon's empire was doubtless the cause of
  this extension of the name of Akkad; from henceforward, in the imperial
  title, "Sumer and Akkad" denoted the whole of Babylonia. After the
  Kassite conquest of the country, northern Babylonia came to be known as
  Kar-Duniyas, "the wall of the god Duniyas," from a line of fortification
  similar to that built by Nebuchadrezzar between Sippara and Opis, so as
  to defend his kingdom from attacks from the north. As this last was "the
  Wall of Semiramis" mentioned by Strabo (xi. 14. 8), Kar-Duniyas may have
  represented the Median Wall of Xenophon (<i>Anab.</i> ii. 4. 12), traces
  of which were found by F.&nbsp;R. Chesney extending from Faluja to Jibbar.</p>

  <p>The country was thickly studded with towns, the sites of which are
  still represented by mounds, though the identification of most of them is
  still doubtful. The latest to be identified are Bismya, between Nippur
  and Erech, which recent American excavations have proved to be the site
  of Udab (also called Adab and Usab) and the neighbouring F&#x101;ra, the
  site of the ancient Kisurra. The dense population was due to the
  elaborate irrigation of the Babylonian plain which had originally
  reclaimed it from a pestiferous and uninhabitable swamp and had made it
  the most fertile country in the world. The science of irrigation and
  engineering seems to have been first created in Babylonia, which was
  covered by a network of canals, all skilfully planned and regulated. The
  three chief of them carried off the waters of the Euphrates to the Tigris
  above Babylon,&mdash;the Zabzallat canal (or <i>Nahr Sarsar</i>) running
  from Faluja to Ctesiphon, the Kutha canal from Sippara to Madain, passing
  Tell Ibrahim or Kutha on the way, and the King's canal or Ar-Malcha
  between the other two. This last, which perhaps owed its name to
  Khammurabi, was conducted from the Euphrates towards Upi or Opis, which
  has been shown by H. Winckler (<i>Altorientalische Forschungen</i>, ii.
  pp. 509 seq.) to have been close to Seleucia on the western side of the
  Tigris. The Pallacopas, called Pallukkatu in the Neo-Babylonian texts,
  started from Pallukkatu or Faluja, and running parallel to the western
  bank of the Euphrates as far as Iddaratu or Teredon (?) watered an
  immense tract of land and supplied a large lake near Borsippa. B.
  Meissner may be right in identifying it with "the Canal of the Sun-god"
  of the early texts. Thanks to this system of irrigation the cultivation
  of the soil was highly advanced in Babylonia. According to Herodotus (i.
  193) wheat commonly returned two hundred-fold to the sower, and
  occasionally three hundred-fold. Pliny (<i>H.&nbsp;N.</i> xviii. 17) states
  that it was cut twice, and afterwards was good keep for sheep, and
  Berossus remarked that wheat, sesame, barley, ochrys, palms, apples and
  many kinds of shelled fruit grew wild, as wheat still does in the
  neighbourhood of Anah. A Persian poem celebrated the 360 uses of the palm
  (Strabo xvi. 1. 14), and Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiv. 3) says that from
  the point reached by Julian's army to the shores of the Persian Gulf was
  one continuous forest of verdure.</p>

  <p>II. <i>Classical Authorities</i>.&mdash;Such a country was naturally
  fitted to be a pioneer of civilization. Before the decipherment of the
  cuneiform texts our knowledge of its history, however, was scanty and
  questionable. Had the native history of Berossus survived, this would not
  have been the case; all that is known of the Chaldaean historian's work,
  however, is derived from quotations in Josephus, Ptolemy, Eusebius and
  the Syncellus. The authenticity of his list of 10 antediluvian kings who
  reigned for 120 <i>sari</i> or 432,000 years, has been partially
  confirmed by the inscriptions; but his 8 postdiluvian dynasties are
  difficult to reconcile with the monuments, and the numbers attached to
  them are probably corrupt. It is different with the 7th and 8th dynasties
  as given by Ptolemy in the <i>Almagest</i>, which prove to have been
  faithfully recorded:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The account of Babylon given by Herodotus is not that of an
  eye-witness, and his historical notices are meagre and untrustworthy. He
  was controverted by Ctesias, who, however, has mistaken mythology for
  history, and Greek romance owed to him its Ninus and Semiramis, its
  Ninyas and Sardanapalus. The only ancient authority of value on
  Babylonian and Assyrian history is the Old Testament.</p>

  <p>III. <i>Modern Discovery.</i>&mdash;The excavations of P.&nbsp;E. Botta and
  A.&nbsp;H. Layard at Nineveh opened up a new world, coinciding as they did
  with the successful decipherment of the cuneiform system of writing.
  Layard's discovery of the library of Assur-bani-pal put the materials for
  reconstructing the ancient life and history of Assyria and Babylonia into
  the hands of scholars. He also was the first to excavate in Babylonia,
  where C.&nbsp;J. Rich had already done useful topographical work. Layard's
  excavations in this latter country were continued by W.&nbsp;K. Loftus, who
  also opened trenches at Susa, as well as by J. Oppert on behalf of the
  French government. But it was only in the last quarter of the 19th
  century that anything like systematic exploration was attempted. After
  the death of George Smith at Aleppo in 1876, an expedition was sent by
  the British Museum (1877-1879), under the conduct of Hormuzd Rassam, to
  continue his work at Nineveh and its neighbourhood. Excavations in the
  mounds of Balaw&#x101;t, called Imgur-Bel by the Assyrians, 15 m. east of
  Mosul, resulted in the discovery of a small temple dedicated to the god
  of dreams by Assur-nazir-pal III. (883 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>),
  containing a stone coffer or ark in which were two inscribed tables of
  alabaster of rectangular shape, as well as of a palace which had been
  destroyed by the Babylonians but restored by Shalmaneser II. (858 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). From the latter came the bronze gates with
  hammered reliefs, which are now in the British Museum. The remains of a
  palace of Assur-nazir-pal III. at Nimr&#x16B;d (Calah) were also
  excavated, and hundreds of enamelled tiles were disinterred. Two years
  later (1880-1881) Rassam was sent to Babylonia, where he discovered the
  site of the temple of the sun-god of Sippara at Abu-Habba, and so fixed
  the position of the two Sipparas or Sepharvaim. Abu-Habba lies south-west
  of Bagdad, midway between the Euphrates and Tigris, on the south side of
  a canal, which may once have represented the main stream of the
  Euphrates, Sippara of the goddess Anunit, now <i>D&#x113;r</i>, being on
  its opposite bank.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile (1877-1881) the French consul, de Sarzec, had been
  excavating at Tello, the ancient Lagash, and bringing to light monuments
  of the pre-Semitic age, which included the diorite statues of Gudea now
  in the Louvre, the stone of which, according to the inscriptions upon
  them, had been brought from Magan, the Sinaitic peninsula. The subsequent
  excavations of de Sarzec in Tello and its neighbourhood carried the
  history of the city back to at least 4000 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  and a collection of more than 30,000 tablets has been found, which were
  arranged on shelves in the time of Gudea (<i>c.</i> 2700 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). In 1886-1887 a German expedition under Dr
  Koldewey explored the cemetery of El Hibba (immediately to the south of
  Tello), and for the first time made us acquainted with the burial customs
  of ancient Babylonia. Another German expedition, on a large scale, was
  despatched by the <i>Orientgesellschaft</i> in 1899 with the object of
  exploring the ruins of Babylon; the palace of Nebuchadrezzar and the
  great processional road were laid bare, and Dr W. Andrae subsequently
  conducted excavations at Qal`at Sherqat, the site of Assur. Even the
  Turkish government has not held aloof from the work of exploration, and
  the Museum at Constantinople is filled with the tablets discovered by Dr
  V. Scheil in 1897 on the site of Sippara. J. de Morgan's exceptionally
  important work at Susa lies outside the limits of Babylonia; not so,
  however, the American excavations (1903-1904) under E.&nbsp;J. Banks at Bismya
  (Udab), and those of the university of Pennsylvania at Niffer (see <span
  class="sc">Nippur</span>) first begun in 1889, where Mr J.&nbsp;H. Haynes has
  systematically and patiently uncovered the remains of the great temple of
  El-lil, removing layer after layer of débris and cutting sections in the
  ruins down to the virgin soil. Midway in the mound is a platform of large
  bricks stamped with the names of Sargon of Akkad and his son Naram-Sin
  (3800 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>); as the débris above them is 34 ft.
  thick, the topmost stratum being not later than the Parthian era (H.&nbsp;V.
  Hilprecht, <i>The Babylonian Expedition</i>, i. 2, p. 23), it is
  calculated that the débris underneath the pavement, 30 ft. thick, must
  represent a period of about 3000 years, more especially as older
  constructions had to be levelled before the pavement was laid. In the
  deepest part of the excavations, however, inscribed clay tablets and
  fragments of stone vases are still found, though the cuneiform characters
  upon them are of a very archaic type, and sometimes even retain their
  primitive pictorial forms.</p>

  <p>IV. <i>Chronology.</i><a name="FnAnchor_091"
  href="#Footnote_091"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The later chronology of Assyria
  has long been fixed, thanks to the lists of <i>limmi</i>, or archons, who
  gave their names in succession to their years of office. Several copies
  of these lists from the library of Nineveh are in existence, the earliest
  of which goes back to 911 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, while the
  latest comes down to the middle of the reign of Assur-bani-pal. The
  beginning of a king's reign is noted in the lists, and in some of them
  the chief events of the year are added to the name of its archon.
  Assyrian chronology is, therefore, certain from 911 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> to 666, and an eclipse of the sun which is
  stated to have been visible in the month Sivan, 763 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, is one that has been calculated to have taken
  place on the 15th of June of that year. The system of reckoning time by
  <i>limmi</i> was of Assyrian origin, and recent discoveries have made it
  clear that it went back to the first days of the monarchy. Even in the
  distant colony at Kara Euyuk near Kaisariyeh (Caesarea) in Cappadocia
  cuneiform tablets show that the Assyrian settlers used it in the 15th
  century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> In Babylonia a different system
  was adopted. Here the years were dated by the chief events that
  distinguished them, as was also the case in Egypt in the epoch of the Old
  Empire. What the event should be was determined by the government and
  notified to all its officials; one of these notices, sent to the
  Babylonian officials in Canaan in the reign of Samsu-iluna, the son of
  Khammurabi, has been found in the Lebanon. A careful register of the
  dates was kept, divided into reigns, from which dynastic lists were
  afterwards compiled, giving the duration of each king's reign as well as
  that of the several dynasties. Two of these dynastic compilations have
  been discovered, unfortunately in an imperfect state.<a
  name="FnAnchor_092" href="#Footnote_092"><sup>[2]</sup></a> In addition
  to the chronological tables, works of a more ambitious and literary
  character were also attempted of the nature of chronicles. One of these
  is the so-called "Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia,"
  consisting of brief notices, written by an Assyrian, of the occasions on
  which the kings of the two countries had entered into relation, hostile
  or otherwise, with one another; a second is the <i>Babylonian
  Chronicle</i> discovered by Dr Th. G. Pinches, which gave a synopsis of
  Babylonian history from a Babylonian point of view, and was compiled in
  the reign of Darius. It is interesting to note that its author says of
  the battle of Khalul&#x113;, which we know from the Assyrian inscriptions
  to have taken place in 691 or 690 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, that he
  does "not know the year" when it was fought: the records of Assyria had
  been already lost, even in Babylonia. The early existence of an accurate
  system of dating is not surprising; it was necessitated by the fact that
  Babylonia was a great trading community, in which it was not only needful
  that commercial and legal documents should be dated, but also that it
  should be possible to refer easily to the dates of former business
  transactions. The Babylonian and Assyrian kings had consequently no
  difficulty in <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[v.03 p.0102]</span>determining the age of their
  predecessors or of past events. Nabonidus (Nabunaid), who was more of an
  antiquarian than a politician, and spent his time in excavating the older
  temples of his country and ascertaining the names of their builders,
  tells us that Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon of Akkad, lived 3200 years
  before himself (<i>i.e.</i> 3750 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), and
  Sagarakti-suryas 800 years; and we learn from Sennacherib that
  Shalmaneser I. reigned 600 years earlier, and that Tiglath-pileser I.
  fought with Merodach-nadin-akhi (Marduk-nadin-akh&#x113;) of Babylon 418
  years before the campaign of 689 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>; while,
  according to Tiglath-pileser I., the high-priest Samas-Hadad, son of
  Isme-Dagon, built the temple of Anu and Hadad at Assur 701 years before
  his own time. Shalmaneser I. in his turn states that the high-priest
  Samas-Hadad, the son of Bel-kabi, governed Assur 580 years previously,
  and that 159 years before this the high-priest Erisum was reigning there.
  The raid of the Elamite king Kutur-Nakhkhunt&#x113; is placed by
  Assur-bani-pal 1635 years before his own conquest of Susa, and Khammurabi
  is said by Nabonidus to have preceded Burna-buryas by 700 years.</p>

  <p>V. <i>History</i>.&mdash;In the earliest period of which we have any
  <span class="sidenote">Early Sumerian period.</span> knowledge Babylonia
  was divided into several independent states, the limits of which were
  defined by canals and boundary stones. Its culture may be traced back to
  two main centres, Eridu in the south and Nippur in the north. But the
  streams of civilization which flowed from them were in strong contrast.
  El-lil, around whose sanctuary Nippur had grown up, was lord of the
  ghost-land, and his gifts to mankind were the spells and incantations
  which the spirits of good or evil were compelled to obey. The world which
  he governed was a mountain; the creatures whom he had made lived
  underground. Eridu, on the other hand, was the home of the culture-god
  Ea, the god of light and beneficence, who employed his divine wisdom in
  healing the sick and restoring the dead to life. Rising each morning from
  his palace in the deep, he had given man the arts and sciences, the
  industries and manners of civilization. To him was due the invention of
  writing, and the first law-book was his creation. Eridu had once been a
  seaport, and it was doubtless its foreign trade and intercourse with
  other lands which influenced the development of its culture. Its
  cosmology was the result of its geographical position: the earth, it was
  believed, had grown out of the waters of the deep, like the ever-widening
  coast at the mouth of the Euphrates. Long before history begins, however,
  the cultures of Eridu and Nippur had coalesced. While Babylon seems to
  have been a colony of Eridu, Ur, the immediate neighbour of Eridu, must
  have been colonized from Nippur, since its moon-god was the son of El-lil
  of Nippur. But in the admixture of the two cultures the influence of
  Eridu was predominant.</p>

  <p>We may call the early civilization of Babylonia Sumerian. The race who
  first developed it spoke an agglutinative language, and to them was due
  the invention of the pictorial hieroglyphs which became the running-hand
  or cuneiform characters of later days, as well as the foundation of the
  chief cities of the country and the elements of its civilization. The
  great engineering works by means of which the marshes were drained and
  the overflow of the rivers regulated by canals went back to Sumerian
  times, like a considerable part of later Babylonian religion and the
  beginnings of Babylonian law. Indeed Sumerian continued to be the
  language of religion and law long after the Semites had become the ruling
  race.</p>

  <p><i>Arrival of the Semites</i>.&mdash;When the Semites first entered
  the <span class="sidenote">Semitic Influence.</span> Edin or plain of
  Babylonia is uncertain, but it must have been at a remote period. The
  cuneiform system of writing was still in process of growth when it was
  borrowed and adapted by the new comers, and the Semitic Babylonian
  language was profoundly influenced by the older language of the country,
  borrowing its words and even its grammatical usages. Sumerian in its turn
  borrowed from Semitic Babylonian, and traces of Semitic influence in some
  of the earliest Sumerian texts indicate that the Semite was already on
  the Babylonian border. His native home was probably Arabia; hence Eridu
  ("the good city") and Ur ("the city") would have been built in Semitic
  territory, and their population may have included Semitic elements from
  the first. It was in the north, however, that the Semites first appear on
  the monuments. Here in Akkad the first Semitic empire was founded,
  Semitic conquerors or settlers spread from Sippara to Susa, Khana to the
  east of the Tigris was occupied by "West Semitic" tribes, and "out of"
  Babylonia "went forth the Assyrian." As in Assyria, so too in the states
  of Babylonia the <i>patesi</i> or high-priest of the god preceded the
  king. The state had grown up around a sanctuary, the god of which was
  nominally its ruler, the human <i>patesi</i> being his viceregent. In
  course of time many of the high-priests assumed the functions and title
  of king; while retaining their priestly office they claimed at the same
  time to be supreme in the state in all secular concerns. The god remained
  nominally at its head; but even this position was lost to him when
  Babylonia was unified under Semitic princes, and the earthly king became
  an incarnate god. A recollection of his former power survived, however,
  at Babylon, where Bel-Merodach adopted the king before his right to rule
  was allowed.</p>

  <p><i>Early Princes</i>.&mdash;The earliest monuments that can be
  approximately <span class="sidenote">Ur-nin&#x101; dynasty.</span> dated
  come from Lagash (Tello). Here we hear of a "king of Kengi," as well as
  of a certain Me-silim, king of Kis, who had dealings with Lugal-suggur,
  high-priest of Lagash, and the high-priest of a neighbouring town, the
  name of which is provisionally transcribed Gis-ukh (formerly written
  Gis-ban and confounded with the name of Opis). According to Scheil,
  Gis-ukh is represented by Jokha, south of F&#x101;ra and west of the
  Shatt el-Hai, and since two of its rulers are called kings of T&#x113; on
  a seal-cylinder, this may have been the pronunciation of the name.<a
  name="FnAnchor_093" href="#Footnote_093"><sup>[3]</sup></a> At a later
  date the high-priests of Lagash made themselves kings, and a dynasty was
  founded there by Ur-Nin&#x101;. In the ruins of a building, attached by
  him to the temple of Nin&#x101;, terra-cotta bas-reliefs of the king and
  his sons have been found, as well as the heads of lions in onyx, which
  remind us of Egyptian work and onyx plates. These were "booty" dedicated
  to the goddess Bau. E-anna-du, the grandson of Ur-Nin&#x101;, made
  himself master of the whole of southern Babylonia, including "the
  district of Sumer" together with the cities of Erech, Ur and Larsa (?).
  He also annexed the kingdom of Kis, which, however, recovered its
  independence after his death. Gis-ukh was made tributary, a certain
  amount of grain being levied upon each person in it, which had to be paid
  into the treasury of the goddess Nin&#x101; and the god Ingurisa. The
  so-called "Stele of the Vultures," now in the Louvre, was erected as a
  monument of the victory. On this various incidents in the war are
  represented. In one scene the king stands in his chariot with a curved
  weapon in his right hand formed of three bars of metal bound together by
  rings (similar, as M.&nbsp;L. Heuzey has pointed out, to one carried by the
  chief of an Asiatic tribe in a tomb of the 12th dynasty at Beni-Hasan in
  Egypt), while his kilted followers with helmets on their heads and lances
  in their hands march behind him. In another a flock of vultures is
  feeding on the bodies of the fallen enemy; in a third a tumulus is being
  heaped up over those who had been slain on the side of Lagash. Elsewhere
  we see the victorious prince beating down a vanquished enemy, and
  superintending the execution of other prisoners who are being sacrificed
  to the gods, while in one curious scene he is striking with his mace a
  sort of wicker-work cage filled with naked men. In his hand he holds the
  crest of Lagash and its god&mdash;a lion-headed eagle with outstretched
  wings, supported by two lions which are set heraldically back to back.
  The sculptures belong to a primitive period of art.</p>

  <p>E-anna-du's campaigns extended beyond the confines of Babylonia. He
  overran a part of Elam and took the city of Az on the Persian Gulf.
  Temples and palaces were repaired or erected at Lagash and elsewhere, the
  town of Nin&#x101;&mdash;which probably gave <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[v.03 p.0103]</span>its name to the
  later Nin&#x101; or Nineveh&mdash;was rebuilt, and canals and reservoirs
  were excavated. He was succeeded by his brother En-anna-tum I., under
  whom Gis-ukh once more became the dominant power. As En-anna-tum has the
  title only of high-priest, it is probable that he acknowledged Ur-lumma
  of Gis-ukh as his suzerain. His son and successor Entemena restored the
  prestige of Lagash. Gis-ukh was subdued and a priest named Illi was made
  its governor. A tripod of silver dedicated by Entemena to his god is now
  in the Louvre. A frieze of lions devouring ibexes and deer, and incised
  with great artistic skill, runs round the neck, while the eagle crest of
  Lagash adorns the globular part. The vase is a proof of the high degree
  of excellence to which the goldsmith's art had already attained. A vase
  of calcite, also dedicated by Entemena, has been found at Nippur.</p>

  <p>The eighth successor of Ur-Nin&#x101; was Uru-duggina, who was
  overthrown and his city captured by Lugal-zaggisi, the high-priest of
  Gis-ukh. Lugal-zaggisi was the founder of the first empire in Asia of
  which we know. He made Erech his capital and calls himself king of Kengi.
  In a long inscription which he caused to be engraved on hundreds of stone
  vases dedicated to El-lil of Nippur, he declares that his kingdom
  extended "from the Lower Sea of the Tigris and Euphrates," or Persian
  Gulf, to "the Upper Sea" or Mediterranean. It was at this time that Erech
  received the name of "the City," which it continued to bear when written
  ideographically.</p>

  <p><i>Semitic Empire of Sargon of Akkad.</i>&mdash;The next empire
  founded <span class="sidenote">Sargon.</span> in western Asia was
  Semitic. Semitic princes had already established themselves at Kis, and a
  long inscription has been discovered at Susa by J. de Morgan, belonging
  to one of them, Manistusu, who like Lugal-zaggisi was a contemporary of
  Uru-duggina. Another Semitic ruler of Kis of the same period was
  Alusarsid (or Urumus) who "subdued Elam and Barahs&#x113;." But the fame
  of these early establishers of Semitic supremacy was far eclipsed by that
  of Sargon of Akkad and his son, Naram-Sin. The date of Sargon is placed
  by Nabonidus at 3800 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> He was the son of
  Itti-Bel, and a legend related how he had been born in concealment and
  sent adrift in an ark of bulrushes on the waters of the Euphrates. Here
  he had been rescued and brought up by "Akki the husbandman"; but the day
  arrived at length when his true origin became known, the crown of
  Babylonia was set upon his head and he entered upon a career of foreign
  conquest. Four times he invaded Syria and Palestine, and spent three
  years in thoroughly subduing the countries of "the west," and in uniting
  them with Babylonia "into a single empire." Images of himself were
  erected on the shores of the Mediterranean in token of his victories, and
  cities and palaces were built at home out of the spoils of the conquered
  lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated,
  and rebellions were put down both in Kazalla and in Babylonia itself.
  Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns
  against Palestine and Sarlak, king of Gutium or Kurdistan, and copper is
  mentioned as being brought from Magan or the Sinaitic peninsula.</p>

  <p>Sargon's son and successor, Naram-Sin, followed up the <span
  class="sidenote">Naram-Sin.</span> successes of his father by marching
  into Magan, whose king he took captive. He assumed the imperial title of
  "king of the four zones," and, like his father, was addressed as a god.
  He is even called "the god of Agad&#x113;" (Akkad), reminding us of the
  divine honours claimed by the Pharaohs of Egypt, whose territory now
  adjoined that of Babylonia. A finely executed bas-relief, representing
  Naram-Sin, and bearing a striking resemblance to early Egyptian art in
  many of its features, has been found at Diarbekr. Babylonian art,
  however, had already attained a high degree of excellence; two seal
  cylinders of the time of Sargon are among the most beautiful specimens of
  the gem-cutter's art ever discovered. The empire was bound together by
  roads, along which there was a regular postal service; and clay seals,
  which took the place of stamps, are now in the Louvre bearing the names
  of Sargon and his son. A cadastral survey seems also to have been
  instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain
  Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his Canaanitish origin, was
  governor of the land of the Amorites, as Syria and Palestine were called
  by the Babylonians. It is probable that the first collection of
  astronomical observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library
  established by Sargon.</p>

  <p>Bingani-sar-ali was the son of Naram-Sin, but we do not yet <span
  class="sidenote">Ur dynasty.</span> know whether he followed his father
  on the throne. Another son was high-priest of the city of Tutu, and in
  the name of his daughter, Lipus-Eaum, a priestess of Sin, some scholars
  have seen that of the Hebrew deity Yahweh. The Babylonian god Ea,
  however, is more likely to be meant. The fall of Sargon's empire seems to
  have been as sudden as its rise. The seat of supreme power in Babylonia
  was shifted southwards to Isin and Ur. It is generally assumed that two
  dynasties reigned at Ur and claimed suzerainty over the other Babylonian
  states, though there is as yet no clear proof that there was more than
  one. It was probably Gungunu who succeeded in transferring the capital of
  Babylonia from Isin to Ur, but his place in the dynasty (or dynasties) is
  still uncertain. One of his successors was Ur-Gur, a great builder, who
  built or restored the temples of the Moon-god at Ur, of the Sun-god at
  Larsa, of Ishtar at Erech and of Bel at Nippur. His son and successor was
  Dungi, whose reign lasted more than 51 years, and among whose vassals was
  Gudea, the <i>patesi</i> or high-priest of Lagash. Gudea was also a great
  builder, and the materials for his buildings and statues were brought
  from all parts of western Asia, cedar wood from the Amanus mountains,
  quarried stones from Lebanon, copper from northern Arabia, gold and
  precious stones from the desert between Palestine and Egypt, dolerite
  from Magan (the Sinaitic peninsula) and timber from Dilmun in the Persian
  Gulf. Some of his statues, now in the Louvre, are carved out of Sinaitic
  dolerite, and on the lap of one of them (statue E) is the plan of his
  palace, with the scale of measurement attached. Six of the statues bore
  special names, and offerings were made to them as to the statues of the
  gods. Gudea claims to have conquered Anshan in Elam, and was succeeded by
  his son Ur-Ningirsu. His date may be provisionally fixed at 2700 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p>This dynasty of Ur was Semitic, not Sumerian, notwithstanding the name
  of Dungi. Dungi was followed by Bur-Sin, Gimil-Sin, and Ibi-Sin. Their
  power extended to the Mediterranean, and we possess a large number of
  contemporaneous monuments in the shape of contracts and similar business
  documents, as well as chronological tables, which belong to their
  reigns.</p>

  <p>After the fall of the dynasty, Babylonia passed under foreign <span
  class="sidenote">Khammurabi.</span> influence. Sumuabi ("Shem is my
  father"), from southern Arabia (or perhaps Canaan), made himself master
  of northern Babylonia, while Elamite invaders occupied the south. After a
  reign of 14 years Sumuabi was succeeded by his son Sumu-la-ilu, in the
  fifth year of whose reign the fortress of Babylon was built, and the city
  became for the first time a capital. Rival kings, Pungun-ila and Immerum,
  are mentioned in the contract tablets as reigning at the same time as
  Sumu-la-ilu (or Samu-la-ilu); and under Sin-muballidh, the great-grandson
  of Sumu-la-ilu, the Elamites laid the whole of the country under tribute,
  and made Eri-Aku or Arioch, called Rim-Sin by his Semitic subjects, king
  of Larsa. Eri-Aku was the son of Kudur-Mabug, who was prince of Yamutbal,
  on the eastern border of Babylonia, and also "governor of Syria." The
  Elamite supremacy was at last shaken off by the son and successor of
  Sin-muballidh, Khammurabi, whose name is also written Ammurapi and
  Khammuram, and who was the Amraphel of Gen. xiv. 1. The Elamites, under
  their king Kudur-Lagamar or Chedor-laomer, seem to have taken Babylon and
  destroyed the temple of Bel-Merodach; but Khammurabi retrieved his
  fortunes, and in the thirtieth year of his reign (in 2340 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) he overthrew the Elamite forces in a decisive
  battle and drove them out of Babylonia. The next two years were occupied
  in adding Larsa and Yamutbal to his dominion, and in forming Babylonia
  into a single monarchy, the head of which was Babylon. A great literary
  revival followed the recovery of Babylonian independence, and the rule of
  Babylon was obeyed as far as the shores of the Mediterranean. Vast
  numbers of contract tablets, dated in the reigns of Khammurabi and other
  kings of the dynasty, have <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>[v.03 p.0104]</span>been discovered, as well as
  autograph letters of the kings themselves, more especially of Khammurabi.
  Among the latter is one ordering the despatch of 240 soldiers from
  Assyria and Situllum, a proof that Assyria was at the time a Babylonian
  dependency. Constant intercourse was kept up between Babylonia and the
  west, Babylonian officials and troops passing to Syria and Canaan, while
  "Amorite" colonists were established in Babylonia for the purposes of
  trade. One of these Amorites, Abi-ramu or Abram by name, is the father of
  a witness to a deed dated in the reign of Khammurabi's grandfather.
  Ammi-ditana, the great-grandson of Khammurabi, still entitles himself
  "king of the land of the Amorites," and both his father and son bear the
  Canaanitish (and south Arabian) names of Abesukh or Abishua and
  Ammi-zadok.</p>

  <p>One of the most important works of this "First Dynasty of Babylon," as
  it was called by the native historians, was the compilation of a code of
  laws (see <span class="sc">Babylonian Law</span>). This was made by order
  of Khammurabi after the expulsion of the Elamites and the settlement of
  his kingdom. A copy of the Code has been found at Susa by J. de Morgan
  and is now in the Louvre, The last king of the dynasty was Samsu-ditana
  the son of Ammi-zadok. He was followed by a dynasty of 11 Sumerian kings,
  who are said to have reigned for 368 years, a number which must be much
  exaggerated. As yet the name of only one of them has been found in a
  contemporaneous document. They were overthrown and Babylonia was
  conquered by Kassites or Kossaeans from the mountains of Elam, with whom
  Samsu-iluna had already come into conflict in his 9th year. The Kassite
  dynasty was founded by Kandis, Gandis or Gaddas (about 1780 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), and lasted for 576¾ years. Under this foreign
  dominion, which offers a striking analogy to the contemporary rule of the
  Hyksos in Egypt, Babylonia lost its empire over western Asia, Syria and
  Palestine became independent, and the high-priests of Assur made
  themselves kings of Assyria. The divine attributes with which the Semitic
  kings of Babylonia had been invested disappeared at the same time; the
  title of "god" is never given to a Kassite sovereign. Babylon, however,
  remained the capital of the kingdom and the holy city of western Asia,
  where the priests were all-powerful, and the right to the inheritance of
  the old Babylonian empire could alone be conferred.</p>

  <p><i>Rise of Assyria</i>.&mdash;Under Khammurabi a Samsi-Hadad (or
  Samsi-Raman) seems to have been vassal-prince at Assur, and the names of
  several of the high-priests of Assur who succeeded him have been made
  known to us by the recent German excavations. The foundation of the
  monarchy was ascribed to Zulilu, who is described as living after
  Bel-kapkapi or Belkabi (1900 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), the
  ancestor of Shalmaneser I. Assyria grew in power at the expense of
  Babylonia, and a time came when the Kassite king of Babylonia was glad to
  marry the daughter of Assur-yuballidh of Assyria, whose letters to
  Amenophis (Amon-hotep) IV. of Egypt have been found at Tell el-Amarna.
  The marriage, however, led to disastrous results, as the Kassite faction
  at court murdered the king and placed a pretender on the throne.
  Assur-yuballidh promptly marched into Babylonia and avenged his
  son-in-law, making Burna-buryas of the royal line king in his stead.
  Burna-buryas, who reigned 22 years, carried on a correspondence with
  Amenophis IV. of Egypt. <span class="sidenote">Shalmaneser I.</span>
  After his death, the Assyrians, who were still nominally the vassals of
  Babylonia, threw off all disguise, and Shalmaneser I. (1300 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), the great-great-grandson of Assur-yuballidh,
  openly claimed the supremacy in western Asia. Shalmaneser was the founder
  of Calah, and his annals, which have recently been discovered at Assur,
  show how widely extended the Assyrian empire already was. Campaign after
  campaign was carried on against the Hittites and the wild tribes of the
  north-west, and Assyrian colonists were settled in Cappadocia. His son
  Tukulti-In-aristi conquered Babylon, putting its king Bitilyasu to death,
  and thereby made Assyria the mistress of the oriental world. Assyria had
  taken the place of Babylonia.</p>

  <p>For 7 years Tukulti-In-aristi ruled at Babylon with the old imperial
  title of "king of Sumer and Akkad." Then the Babylonians revolted. The
  Assyrian king was murdered by his son, Assur-nazir-pal I., and
  Hadad-nadin-akhi made king of Babylonia. But it was not until several
  years later, in the reign of the Assyrian king Tukulti-Assur, that a
  reconciliation was effected between the two rival kingdoms. The next
  Assyrian monarch, Bel-kudur-uzur, was the last of the old royal line. He
  seems to have been slain fighting against the Babylonians, who were still
  under the rule of Hadad-nadin-akhi, and a new dynasty was established at
  Assur by In-aristi-pileser, who claimed to be a descendant of the ancient
  prince Erba-Raman. <span class="sidenote">Tiglath-pileser I.</span> His
  fourth successor was Tiglath-pileser I., one of the great conquerors of
  Assyria, who carried his arms towards Armenia on the north and Cappadocia
  on the west; he hunted wild bulls in the Lebanon and was presented with a
  crocodile by the Egyptian king. In 1107 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  however, he sustained a temporary defeat at the hands of
  Merodach-nadin-akhi (Marduk-nadin-akh&#x113;) of Babylonia, where the
  Kassite dynasty had finally succumbed to Elamite attacks and a new line
  of kings was on the throne.</p>

  <p>Of the immediate successors of Tiglath-pileser I. we know <span
  class="sidenote">Assur-nazir-pal III.</span> little, and it is with
  Assur-nazir-pal III. (883-858 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) that our
  knowledge of Assyrian history begins once more to be fairly full. The
  empire of Assyria was again extended in all directions, and the palaces,
  temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable
  development of wealth and art. Calah became the favourite residence of a
  monarch who was distinguished even among Assyrian conquerors for his
  revolting cruelties. <span class="sidenote">Shalmaneser II.</span> His
  son Shalmaneser II. had a long reign of 35 years, during which the
  Assyrian capital was converted into a sort of armed camp. Each year the
  Assyrian armies marched out of it to plunder and destroy. Babylon was
  occupied and the country reduced to vassalage. In the west the
  confederacy of Syrian princes headed by Benhadad of Damascus and
  including Ahab of Israel (see <span class="sc">Jews</span>, § 10) was
  shattered in 853 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and twelve years later
  the forces of Hazael were annihilated and the ambassadors of Jehu of
  Samaria brought tribute to "the great king." The last few years of his
  life, however, were disturbed by the rebellion of his eldest son, which
  well-nigh proved fatal. Assur, Arbela and other places joined the
  pretender, and the revolt was with difficulty put down by Samsi-Raman (or
  Samsi-Hadad), Shalmaneser's second son, who soon afterwards succeeded him
  (824 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>). In 804 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Damascus was captured by his successor
  Hadad-nirari IV., to whom tribute was paid by Samaria.</p>

  <p>With Nabu-nazir, the Nabonassar of classical writers, the so-called
  <span class="sidenote">Nabu-nazir.</span> Canon of Ptolemy begins. When
  he ascended the throne of Babylon in 747 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  Assyria was in the throes of a revolution. Civil war and pestilence were
  devastating the country, and its northern provinces had been wrested from
  it by Ararat. In 746 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Calah joined the
  rebels, and on the 13th of Iyyar in the following year, Pulu or Pul, who
  took the name of Tiglath-pileser III., seized the crown and inaugurated a
  new and vigorous policy.</p>

  <p><i>Second Assyrian Empire.</i>&mdash;Under Tiglath-pileser III. arose
  the <span class="sidenote">Tiglath-pileser III.</span> second Assyrian
  empire, which differed from the first in its greater consolidation. For
  the first time in history the idea of centralization was introduced into
  politics; the conquered provinces were organized under an elaborate
  bureaucracy at the head of which was the king, each district paying a
  fixed tribute and providing a military contingent. The Assyrian forces
  became a standing army, which, by successive improvements and careful
  discipline, was moulded into an irresistible fighting machine, and
  Assyrian policy was directed towards the definite object of reducing the
  whole civilized world into a single empire and thereby throwing its trade
  and wealth into Assyrian hands. With this object, after terrorizing
  Armenia and the Medes and breaking the power of the Hittites,
  Tiglath-pileser III. secured the high-roads of commerce to the
  Mediterranean together with the Phoenician seaports and then made himself
  master of Babylonia. In 729 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> the summit of
  his ambition was attained, and he was invested with the sovereignty of
  Asia in the holy city of Babylon. Two years later, in Tebet <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[v.03 p.0105]</span>727
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, he died, but his successor Ulul&#x101;,
  who took the name of Shalmaneser IV., continued the policy he had begun.
  Shalmaneser died suddenly in Tebet 722 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  while pressing the siege of Samaria, and the seizure of the throne by
  another general, Sargon, on the 12th of the month, gave the Babylonians
  an opportunity to revolt. <span class="sidenote">Merodach-baladan.</span>
  In Nisan the Kald&#x101; prince, Merodach (Marduk)-baladan, entered
  Babylon and was there crowned legitimate king. For twelve years he
  successfully resisted the Assyrians; but the failure of his allies in the
  west to act in concert with him, and the overthrow of the Elamites,
  eventually compelled him to fly to his ancestral domains in the marshes
  of southern Babylonia. Sargon, who meanwhile had crushed the confederacy
  of the northern nations, had taken (717 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>)
  the Hittite stronghold of Carchemish and had annexed the future kingdom
  of Ecbatana, was now accepted as king by the Babylonian priests and his
  claim to be the successor of Sargon of Akkad acknowledged up to the time
  of his murder in 705 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> <span
  class="sidenote">Sennacherib.</span> His son Sennacherib, who succeeded
  him on the 12th of Ab, did not possess the military or administrative
  abilities of his father, and the success of his reign was not
  commensurate with the vanity of the ruler. He was never crowned at
  Babylon, which was in a perpetual state of revolt until, in 691 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, he shocked the religious and political
  conscience of Asia by razing the holy city of Babylon to the ground. His
  campaign against Hezekiah of Judah was as much a failure as his policy in
  Babylonia, and in his murder by his sons on the 20th of Tebet 681 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> both Babylonians and Jews saw the judgment of
  heaven.</p>

  <p>Esar-haddon, who succeeded him, was of different calibre from <span
  class="sidenote">Esar-haddon.</span> his father. He was commanding the
  army in a campaign against Ararat at the time of the murder; forty-two
  days later the murderers fled from Nineveh and took refuge at the court
  of Ararat. But the Armenian army was utterly defeated near Malatia on the
  12th of Iyyar, and at the end of the day Esar-haddon was saluted by his
  soldiers as king. He thereupon returned to Nineveh and on the 8th of
  Sivan formally ascended the throne.</p>

  <p>One of his first acts was to restore Babylon, to send back the image
  of Bel-Merodach (Bel-Marduk) to its old home, and to re-people the city
  with such of the priests and the former population as had survived
  massacre. Then he was solemnly declared king in the temple of
  Bel-Merodach, which had again risen from its ruins, and Babylon became
  the second capital of the empire. Esar-haddon's policy was successful and
  Babylonia remained contentedly quiet throughout his reign. In February
  (674 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) the Assyrians entered upon their
  invasion of Egypt (see also <span class="sc">Egypt</span>:
  <i>History</i>), and in Nisan (or March) 670 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> an expedition on an unusually large scale set
  out from Nineveh. The Egyptian frontier was crossed on the 3rd of Tammuz
  (June), and Tirhaka, at the head of the Egyptian forces, was driven to
  Memphis after fifteen days of continuous fighting, during which the
  Egyptians were thrice defeated with heavy loss and Tirhaka himself was
  wounded. On the 22nd of the month Memphis was entered by the victorious
  army and Tirhaka fled to the south. A stele, commemorating the victory
  and representing Tirhaka with the features of a negro, was set up at
  Sinjirli (north of the Gulf of Antioch) and is now in the Berlin Museum.
  Two years later (668 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) Egypt revolted, and
  while on the march to reduce it, Esar-haddon fell ill and died (on the
  10th of Marchesvan or October). <span
  class="sidenote">Assur-bani-pal.</span> Assur-bani-pal succeeded him as
  king of Assyria and its empire, while his brother, Samas-sum-yukin, was
  made viceroy of Babylonia. The arrangement was evidently intended to
  flatter the Babylonians by giving them once more the semblance of
  independence. But it failed to work. Samas-sum-yukin became more
  Babylonian than his subjects; the viceroy claimed to be the successor of
  the monarchs whose empire had once stretched to the Mediterranean; even
  the Sumerian language was revived as the official tongue, and a revolt
  broke out which shook the Assyrian empire to its foundations. After
  several years of struggle, during which Egypt recovered its independence,
  Babylon was starved into surrender, and the rebel viceroy and his
  supporters were put to death.</p>

  <p>Egypt had already recovered its independence (660 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) with the help of mercenaries sent by Gyges of
  Lydia, who had vainly solicited aid from Assyria against his Cimmerian
  enemies. Next followed the contest with Elam, in spite of the efforts of
  Assur-bani-pal to ward it off. Assyria, however, was aided by civil war
  in Elam itself; the country was wasted with fire and sword, and its
  capital Susa or Shushan levelled with the ground. But the long struggle
  left Assyria maimed and exhausted. It had been drained of both wealth and
  fighting population; the devastated provinces of Elam and Babylonia could
  yield nothing with which to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer,
  and it was difficult to find sufficient troops even to garrison the
  conquered populations. Assyria, therefore, was ill prepared to face the
  hordes of Scythians&mdash;or Manda, as they were called by the
  Babylonians&mdash;who now began to harass the frontiers. A Scythian power
  had grown up in the old kingdom of Ellip, to the east of Assyria, where
  Ecbatana was built by a "Manda" prince; Asia Minor was infested by the
  Scythian tribe of Cimmerians, and the death of the Scythian leader
  Dugdamm&#x113; (the Lygdamis of Strabo i. 3. 16) was regarded by
  Assur-bani-pal as a special mark of divine favour.</p>

  <p>When Assur-bani-pal died, his empire was fast breaking up. <span
  class="sidenote">Scythian influence.</span> Under his successor,
  Assur-etil-ilani, the Scythians penetrated into Assyria and made their
  way as far as the borders of Egypt. Calah was burned, though the strong
  walls of Nineveh protected the relics of the Assyrian army which had
  taken refuge behind them; and when the raiders had passed on to other
  fields of booty, a new palace was erected among the ruins of the
  neighbouring city. But its architectural poverty and small size show that
  the resources of Assyria were at a low ebb. A contract has been found at
  Sippara, dated in the fourth year of Assur-etil-ilani, though it is
  possible that his rule in Babylonia was disputed by his Rab-shakeh
  (vizier), Assur-sum-lisir, whose accession year as king of Assyria occurs
  on a contract from Nippur (Niffer). The last king of Assyria was probably
  the brother of Assur-etil-ilani, Sin-sar-iskun (Sin-sarra-uzur), who
  seems to have been the Sarakos (Saracus) of Berossus. He was still
  reigning in Babylonia in his seventh year, as a contract dated in that
  year has been discovered at Erech, and an inscription of his, in which he
  speaks of restoring the ruined temples and their priests, couples
  Merodach of Babylon with Assur of Nineveh. Babylonia, however, was again
  restless. After the over throw of Samas-sum-yukin, Kandalanu, the
  Chineladanos of Ptolemy's canon, had been appointed viceroy. <span
  class="sidenote">Nabopolassar.</span> His successor was Nabopolassar,
  between whom and the last king of Assyria war broke out. The Scythian
  king of Ecbatana, the Cyaxares of the Greeks, came to the help of the
  Babylonians. Nineveh was captured and destroyed by the Scythian army,
  along with those cities of northern Babylonia which had sided with
  Babylonia, and the Assyrian empire was at an end.</p>

  <p>The seat of empire was now transferred to Babylonia. Nabopolassar
  <span class="sidenote">Nabonidus.</span> was followed by his son
  Nebuchadrezzar II., whose reign of 43 years made Babylon once more the
  mistress of the civilized world. Only a small fragment of his annals has
  been discovered relating to his invasion of Egypt in 567 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and referring to "Phut of the Ionians." Of the
  reign of the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, however, and the conquest
  of Babylonia by Cyrus, we now have a fair amount of information.<a
  name="FnAnchor_094" href="#Footnote_094"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This is
  chiefly derived from a chronological tablet containing the annals of
  Nabonidus, which is supplemented by an inscription of Nabonidus, in which
  he recounts his restoration of the temple of the Moon-god at Harran, as
  well as by a proclamation of Cyrus issued shortly after his formal
  recognition as king of Babylonia. It was in the sixth year of Nabonidus
  (549 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>)&mdash;or perhaps in 553&mdash;that
  Cyrus, "king of Anshan" in Elam, revolted against his suzerain Astyages,
  king of "the Manda" or Scythians, at Ecbatana. The army of Astyages
  betrayed him to his enemy, and Cyrus (<i>q.v.</i>) established himself at
  Ecbatana, thus putting an end to the empire of the Scythians, <!-- Page
  106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[v.03
  p.0106]</span>which the Greek writers called that of the Medes, through a
  confusion of Mad&#x101; or "Medes" with Manda. <span
  class="sidenote">Invasion by Cyrus.</span> Three years later we find that
  Cyrus has become king of Persia and is engaged in a campaign in the north
  of Mesopotamia. Meanwhile Nabonidus has established a camp at Sippara,
  near the northern frontier of his kingdom, his son&mdash;probably the
  Belshazzar of other inscriptions&mdash;being in command of the army. In
  538 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was
  fought at Opis in the month of June, in which the Babylonians were
  defeated, and immediately afterwards Sippara surrendered to the invader.
  Nabonidus fled to Babylon, whither he was pursued by Gobryas, the
  governor of Kurdistan, and on the 16th of Tammuz, two days after the
  capture of Sippara, "the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without
  fighting." Nabonidus was dragged out of his hiding-place, and Kurdish
  guards were placed at the gates of the great temple of Bel, where the
  services continued without intermission. Cyrus did not arrive till the
  3rd of Marchesvan (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence.
  Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon, and a few days
  afterwards the son of Nabonidus, according to the most probable reading,
  died. A public mourning followed, which lasted six days, and Cambyses
  accompanied the corpse to the tomb. Cyrus now claimed to be the
  legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of
  Bel-Merodach, who was wrathful at the impiety of Nabonidus in removing
  the images of the local gods from their ancestral shrines to his capital
  Babylon. Nabonidus, in fact, had excited a strong feeling against himself
  by attempting to centralize the religion of Babylonia in the temple of
  Merodach (Marduk) at Babylon, and while he had thus alienated the local
  priesthoods the military party despised him on account of his antiquarian
  tastes. He seems to have left the defence of his kingdom to others,
  occupying himself with the more congenial work of excavating the
  foundation records of the temples and determining the dates of their
  builders. The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless facilitated by
  the existence of a disaffected party in the state, as well as by the
  presence of foreign exiles like the Jews, who had been planted in the
  midst of the country. One of the first acts of Cyrus accordingly was to
  allow these exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them the
  images of their gods and their sacred vessels. The permission to do so
  was embodied in a proclamation, in which the conqueror endeavoured to
  justify his claim to the Babylonian throne. The feeling was still strong
  that none had a right to rule over western Asia until he had been
  consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests; and from henceforth,
  accordingly, Cyrus assumed the imperial title of "king of Babylon." A
  year before his death, in 529 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, he
  associated his son Cambyses (<i>q.v.</i>) in the government, making him
  king of Babylon, while he reserved for himself the fuller title of "king
  of the (other) provinces" of the empire. It was only when Darius
  Hystaspis, the representative of the Aryan race and the Zoroastrian
  religion, had re-conquered the empire of Cyrus, that the old tradition
  was broken and the claim of Babylon to confer legitimacy on the rulers of
  western Asia ceased to be acknowledged (see <span
  class="sc">Darius</span>). Darius, in fact, entered Babylon as a
  conqueror; after the murder of the Magian it had recovered its
  independence under Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of Nebuchadrezzar III.,
  and reigned from October 521 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to August 520
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the Persians took it by storm. A few
  years later, probably 514 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, Babylon again
  revolted under the Armenian Arakha; on this occasion, after its capture
  by the Persians, the walls were partly destroyed. E-Saggila, the great
  temple of Bel, however, still continued to be kept in repair and to be a
  centre of Babylonian patriotism, until at last the foundation of Seleucia
  diverted the population to the new capital of Babylonia and the ruins of
  the old city became a quarry for the builders of the new seat of
  government.<a name="FnAnchor_095"
  href="#Footnote_095"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>VI. <i>Assyria and Babylonia contrasted.</i>&mdash;The sister-states
  of Babylonia and Assyria differed essentially in character. Babylonia was
  a land of merchants and agriculturists; Assyria was an organized camp.
  The Assyrian dynasties were founded <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[v.03 p.0107]</span>by successful
  generals; in Babylonia it was the priests whom a revolution raised to the
  throne. The Babylonian king remained a priest to the last, under the
  control of a powerful hierarchy; the Assyrian king was the autocratic
  general of an army, at whose side stood in early days a feudal nobility,
  and from the reign of Tiglath-pileser III. onwards an elaborate
  bureaucracy. His palace was more sumptuous than the temples of the gods,
  from which it was quite separate. The people were soldiers and little
  else; even the sailor belonged to Babylonia. Hence the sudden collapse of
  Assyria when drained of its fighting population in the age of
  Assur-bani-pal.</p>

  <p>VII. <i>Assyro-Babylonian Culture</i>.&mdash;Assyrian culture came
  from Babylonia, but even here there was a difference between the two
  countries. There was little in Assyrian literature that was original, and
  education, which was general in Babylonia, was in the northern kingdom
  confined for the most part to a single class. In Babylonia it was of very
  old standing. There were libraries in most of the towns and temples; an
  old Sumerian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of
  the scribes must rise with the dawn." Women as well as men learned to
  read and write, and in Semitic times this involved a knowledge of the
  extinct Sumerian as well as of a most complicated and extensive
  syllabary. A considerable amount of Semitic Babylonian literature was
  translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law
  long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Chaldaea.
  Vocabularies, grammars and interlinear translations were compiled for the
  use of students as well as commentaries on the older texts and
  explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the
  syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists of them were
  drawn up. The literature was for the most part inscribed with a metal
  stylus on tablets of clay, called <i>laterculae coctiles</i> by Pliny;
  the papyrus which seems to have been also employed has perished. Under
  the second Assyrian empire, when Nineveh had become a great centre of
  trade, Aramaic&mdash;the language of commerce and diplomacy&mdash;was
  added to the number of subjects which the educated class was required to
  learn. Under the Seleucids Greek was introduced into Babylon, and
  fragments of tablets have been found with Sumerian and Assyrian
  (<i>i.e.</i> Semitic Babylonian) words transcribed in Greek letters.</p>

  <p><i>Babylonian Literature and Science</i>.&mdash;There were many
  literary works the titles of which have come down to us. One of the most
  famous of these was the <i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, in twelve books,
  composed by a certain Sin-liqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical
  principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the
  career of Gilgamesh. The whole story is a composite product, and it is
  possible that some of the stories are artificially attached to the
  central figure. (See <span class="sc">Gilgamesh, Epic of</span>.)</p>

  <p>Another epic was that of the Creation, the object of which was to
  glorify Bel-Merodach by describing his contest with Tiamat, the dragon of
  chaos. In the first book an account is given of the creation of the world
  out of the primeval deep and the birth of the gods of light. Then comes
  the story of the struggle between the gods of light and the powers of
  darkness, and the final victory of Merodach, who clove Tiamat asunder,
  forming the heaven out of one half of her body and the earth out of the
  other. Merodach next arranged the stars in order, along with the sun and
  moon, and gave them laws which they were never to transgress. After this
  the plants and animals were created, and finally man. Merodach here takes
  the place of Ea, who appears as the creator in the older legends, and is
  said to have fashioned man out of the clay.</p>

  <p>The legend of Adapa, the first man, a portion of which was found in
  the record-office of the Egyptian king Amenophis IV. (Akhenaton) at
  Tell-el-Amarna, explains the origin of death. Adapa while fishing had
  broken the wings of the south wind, and was accordingly summoned before
  the tribunal of Anu in heaven. Ea counselled him not to eat or drink
  there. He followed the advice, and thus refused the food which would have
  made him and his descendants immortal.</p>

  <p>Among the other legends of Babylonia may be mentioned those of Namtar,
  the plague-demon, of Urra, the pestilence, of Etanna and of Zu. Hades,
  the abode of Nin-erisgal or Allat, had been entered by Nergal, who,
  angered by a message sent to her by the gods of the upper world, ordered
  Namtar to strike off her head. She, however, declared that she would
  submit to any conditions imposed on her and would give Nergal the
  sovereignty of the earth. Nergal accordingly relented, and Allatu became
  the queen of the infernal world. Etanna conspired with the eagle to fly
  to the highest heaven. The first gate, that of Anu, was successfully
  reached; but in ascending still farther to the gate of Ishtar the
  strength of the eagle gave way, and Etanna was dashed to the ground. As
  for the storm-god Zu, we are told that he stole the tablets of destiny,
  and therewith the prerogatives of Bel. God after god was ordered to
  pursue him and recover them, but it would seem that it was only by a
  stratagem that they were finally regained.</p>

  <p>Besides the purely literary works there were others of the most varied
  nature, including collections of letters, partly official, partly
  private. Among them the most interesting are the letters of Khammurabi,
  which have been edited by L.&nbsp;W. King. Astronomy and astrology, moreover,
  occupy a conspicuous place. Astronomy was of old standing in Babylonia,
  and the standard work on the subject, written from an astrological point
  of view, which was translated into Greek by Berossus, was believed to go
  back to the age of Sargon of Akkad. The zodiac was a Babylonian invention
  of great antiquity; and eclipses of the sun as well as of the moon could
  be foretold. Observatories were attached to the temples, and reports were
  regularly sent by the astronomers to the king. The stars had been
  numbered and named at an early date, and we possess tables of lunar
  longitudes and observations of the phases of Venus. In Seleucid and
  Parthian times the astronomical reports were of a thoroughly scientific
  character; how far the advanced knowledge and method they display may
  reach back we do not yet know. Great attention was naturally paid to the
  calendar, and we find a week of seven and another of five days in use.
  The development of astronomy implies considerable progress in
  mathematics; it is not surprising, therefore, that the Babylonians should
  have invented an extremely simple method of ciphering or have discovered
  the convenience of the duodecimal system. The <i>ner</i> of 600 and the
  <i>sar</i> of 3600 were formed from the <i>soss</i> or unit of 60, which
  corresponded with a degree of the equator. Tablets <!-- Page 108 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[v.03 p.0108]</span>of squares and
  cubes, calculated from 1 to 60, have been found at Senkera, and a people
  who were acquainted with the sun-dial, the clepsydra, the lever and the
  pulley, must have had no mean knowledge of mechanics. A crystal lens,
  turned on the lathe, was discovered by Layard at Nimrud along with glass
  vases bearing the name of Sargon; this will explain the excessive
  minuteness of some of the writing on the Assyrian tablets, and a lens may
  also have been used in the observation of the heavens.</p>

  <p><i>Art and Architecture</i>.&mdash;The culture of Assyria, and still
  more of Babylonia, was essentially literary; we miss in it the artistic
  spirit of Egypt or Greece. In Babylonia the abundance of clay and want of
  stone led to the employment of brick; the Babylonian temples are massive
  but shapeless structures of crude brick, supported by buttresses, the
  rain being carried off by drains, one of which at Ur was of lead. The use
  of brick led to the early development of the pilaster and column, as well
  as of frescoes and enamelled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured,
  and sometimes plated with bronze or gold as well as with tiles. Painted
  terra-cotta cones were also embedded in the plaster. Assyria in this, as
  in other matters, the servile pupil of Babylonia, built its palaces and
  temples of brick, though stone was the natural building material of the
  country, even preserving the brick platform, so necessary in the marshy
  soil of Babylonia, but little needed in the north. As time went on,
  however, the later Assyrian architect began to shake himself free from
  Babylonian influences and to employ stone as well as brick. The walls of
  the Assyrian palaces were lined with sculptured and coloured slabs of
  stone, instead of being painted as in Chaldaea. We can. trace three
  periods in the art of these bas-reliefs; it is vigorous but simple under
  Assur-nazir-pal III., careful and realistic under Sargon, refined but
  wanting in boldness under Assur-bani-pal. In Babylonia, in place of the
  bas-relief we have the figure in the round, the earliest examples being
  the statues from Tello which are realistic but somewhat clumsy. The want
  of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high
  perfection in the art of gem-cutting. Nothing can be better than two
  seal-cylinders that have come down to us from the age of Sargon of Akkad.
  No remarkable specimens of the metallurgic art of an early period have
  been found, apart perhaps from the silver vase of Entemena, but at a
  later epoch great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such
  jewellery as ear-rings and bracelets of gold. Copper, too, was worked
  with skill; indeed, it is possible that Babylonia was the original home
  of copper-working, which spread westward with the civilization to which
  it belonged. At any rate the people were famous from an early date for
  their embroideries and rugs. The ceramic history of Babylonia and Assyria
  has unfortunately not yet been traced; at Susa alone has the care
  demanded by the modern methods of archaeology been as yet expended on
  examining and separating the pottery found in the excavations, and Susa
  is not Babylonia. We do not even know the date of the spirited
  terra-cotta reliefs discovered by Loftus and Rawlinson. The forms of
  Assyrian pottery, however, are graceful; the porcelain, like the glass
  discovered in the palaces of Nineveh, was derived from Egyptian
  originals. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the
  reign of Sargon. Stone as well as clay and glass were employed in the
  manufacture of vases, and vases of hard stone have been disinterred at
  Tello similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.</p>

  <p><i>Social Life</i>.&mdash;Castes were unknown in both Babylonia and
  Assyria, but the priesthood of Babylonia found its counterpart in the
  military aristocracy of Assyria. The priesthood was divided into a great
  number of classes, among which that of the doctors may be reckoned. The
  army was raised, at all events in part, by conscription; a standing army
  seems to have been first organized in Assyria. Successive improvements
  were introduced into it by the kings of the second Assyrian empire;
  chariots were superseded by cavalry; Tiglath-pileser III. gave the riders
  saddles and high boots, and Sennacherib created a corps of slingers.
  Tents, baggage-carts and battering-rams were carried on the march, and
  the <i>tartan</i> or commander-in-chief ranked next to the king. In both
  countries there was a large body of slaves; above them came the
  agriculturists and commercial classes, who were, however, comparatively
  little numerous in Assyria. The scribes, on the other hand, formed a more
  important class in Assyria than in Babylonia. Both countries had their
  artisans, money-lenders, poets and musicians.</p>

  <p>The houses of the people contained but little furniture; chairs,
  tables and couches, however, were used, and Assur-bani-pal is represented
  as reclining on his couch at a meal while his wife sits on a chair beside
  him. After death the body was usually partially cremated along with the
  objects that had been buried with it. The cemetery adjoined the city of
  the living and was laid out in streets through which ran rivulets of
  "pure" water. Many of the tombs, which were built of crude brick, were
  provided with gardens, and there were shelves or altars on which were
  placed the offerings to the dead. As the older tombs decayed a fresh city
  of tombs arose on their ruins. It is remarkable that thus far no cemetery
  older than the Seleucid or Parthian period has been found in Assyria.</p>

  <p>VIII. <i>Chronological Systems</i>.&mdash;The extreme divergence in
  the chronological schemes employed by different writers on the history of
  Babylonia and Assyria has frequently caused no small perplexity to
  readers who have no special knowledge of the subject. In this section an
  attempt is made to indicate briefly the causes which have led to so great
  a diversity of opinion, and to describe in outline the principles
  underlying the chief schemes of chronology that have been suggested; a
  short account will then be given of the latest discoveries in this branch
  of research, and of the manner in which they affect the problems at
  issue. It will be convenient to begin with the later historical periods,
  and then to push our inquiry back into the earlier periods of Babylonian
  and Sumerian history.</p>

  <p>Up to certain points no difference of opinion exists upon the dates to
  be assigned to the later kings who ruled in Babylon and in Assyria. The
  Ptolemaic Canon (see sect. II.) gives a list of the Babylonian, Assyrian
  and Persian kings who ruled in Babylon, together with the number of years
  each of them reigned, from the accession of Nabonassar in 747 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> to the conquest of Babylon by Alexander the
  Great in 331 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The accuracy of this list is
  confirmed by the larger List of Kings and by the principal Babylonian
  Chronicle; the latter, like the Canon, begins with the reign of
  Nabonassar, who, it has been suggested, may have revised the calendar and
  have inaugurated a new epoch for the later chronology. The Ptolemaic
  Canon is further controlled and its accuracy confirmed by the Assyrian
  Eponym Lists, or lists of <i>limmi</i> (see sect. II.), by means of which
  Assyrian chronology is fixed from 911 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to
  666 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, the solar eclipse of June 15th, 763
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, which is recorded in the eponymy of
  Pur-Sagale, placing the dead reckoning for these later periods upon an
  absolutely certain basis.</p>

  <p>Thus all historians are agreed with regard to the Babylonian
  chronology back to the year 747 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and with
  regard to that of Assyria back to the year 911 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> It is in respect of the periods anterior to
  these two dates that different writers have propounded differing systems
  of chronology, and, as might be imagined, the earlier the period we
  examine the greater becomes the discrepancy between the systems proposed.
  This variety of opinion is due to the fact that the data available for
  settling the chronology often conflict with one another, or are capable
  of more than one interpretation.</p>

  <p>Since its publication in 1884 the Babylonian List of Kings has
  furnished the framework for every chronological system that has <!-- Page
  109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[v.03
  p.0109]</span>been proposed. In its original form this document gave a
  list, arranged in dynasties, of the Babylonian kings, from the First
  Dynasty of Babylon down to the Neo-Babylonian period. If the text were
  complete we should probably be in possession of the system of Babylonian
  chronology current in the Neo-Babylonian period from which our principal
  classical authorities (see sect. II.) derived their information. The
  principal points of uncertainty, due to gaps in the text, concern the
  length of Dynasties IV. and VIII.; for the reading of the figure giving
  the length of the former is disputed, and the summary at the close of the
  latter omits to state its length. This omission is much to be regretted,
  since Nabonassar was the last king but two of this dynasty, and, had we
  known its duration, we could have combined the information on the earlier
  periods furnished by the Kings' List with the evidence of the Ptolemaic
  Canon. In addition to the Kings' List, other important chronological data
  consist of references in the classical authorities to the chronological
  system of Berossus (<i>q.v.</i>); chronological references to earlier
  kings occurring in the later native inscriptions, such as Nabonidus's
  estimate of the period of Khammurabi (or Hammuribi); synchronisms, also
  furnished by the inscriptions, between kings of Babylon and of Assyria;
  and the early Babylonian date-lists.</p>

  <p>In view of the uncertainty regarding the length of Dynasties IV. and
  VIII. of the Kings' List, attempts have been made to ascertain the dates
  of the earlier dynasties by independent means. The majority of writers,
  after fixing the date at which Dynasty III. closed by means of the
  synchronisms and certain of the later chronological references, have
  accepted the figures of the Kings' List for the earlier dynasties,
  ignoring their apparent inconsistencies with the system of Berossus and
  with the chronology of Nabonidus. Others have attempted to reconcile the
  conflicting data by emendations of the figures and other ingenious
  devices. This will explain the fact that while the difference between the
  earliest and latest dates suggested for the close of Dynasty III. is only
  144 years, the difference between the earliest and latest dates suggested
  for the beginning of Dynasty I. is no less than 622 years. A comparison
  of the principal schemes of chronology that have been propounded may be
  made by means of the preceding table. The first column gives the names of
  the writers and the dates at which their schemes were published, while
  the remaining columns give the dates they have suggested for Dynasties
  I., II. and III. of the Kings' List.<a name="FnAnchor_096"
  href="#Footnote_096"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The systems with the highest
  dates are placed first in the list; where a writer has produced more than
  one system, these are grouped together, the highest dates proposed by him
  determining his place in the series.</p>

  <p>Omitting that of Oppert, which to some extent stands in a category by
  itself, the systems fall into three groups. The first group, comprising
  the second to the sixth names, obtains its results by selecting the data
  on which it relies and ignoring others. The second group, comprising the
  next four names, attempts to reconcile the conflicting data by emending
  the figures. The third group, consisting of the last two names, is
  differentiated by its proposals with regard to Dynasty II. It will be
  noted that the first group has obtained higher dates than the second, and
  the second group higher dates on the whole than the third.</p>

  <p>Oppert's system<a name="FnAnchor_097"
  href="#Footnote_097"><sup>[7]</sup></a> represents the earliest dates
  that have been suggested. He accepted the figures of the Kings' List and
  claimed that he reconciled them with the figures of Berossus, though he
  ignored the later chronological notices. But there is no evidence for his
  "cyclic date" of 2517 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, on which his system
  depended, and there is little doubt that the beginning of the historical
  period of Berossus is to be set, not in 2506 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, but in 2232 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The
  two systems of Sayce,<a name="FnAnchor_098"
  href="#Footnote_098"><sup>[8]</sup></a> that of Rogers,<a
  name="FnAnchor_099" href="#Footnote_099"><sup>[9]</sup></a> the three
  systems of Winckler,<a name="FnAnchor_0910"
  href="#Footnote_0910"><sup>[10]</sup></a> both those of Delitzsch,<a
  name="FnAnchor_0911" href="#Footnote_0911"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and that
  of Maspero,<a name="FnAnchor_0912"
  href="#Footnote_0912"><sup>[12]</sup></a> may be grouped together, for
  they are based on the same principle. Having first fixed the date of the
  close of Dynasty III., they employed the figures of the Kings' List
  unemended for defining the earlier periods, and did not attempt to
  reconcile their results with other conflicting data. The difference of
  eighteen years in Sayce's two dates for the rise of Dynasty I. was due to
  his employing in 1902 the figures assigned to the first seven kings of
  the dynasty upon the larger of the two contemporary date-lists, which had
  meanwhile been published, in place of those given by the List of Kings.
  It should be noted that Winckler (1905) and Delitzsch (1907) gives the
  dates only in round numbers.</p>

  <p>A second group of systems may be said to consist of those proposed by
  Lehmann-Haupt, Marquart, Peiser, and Rost, for these writers attempted to
  get over the discrepancies in the data by emending some of the figures
  furnished by the inscriptions. In 1891, with the object of getting the
  total duration of the dynasties to agree with the chronological system of
  Berossus and with the statement of Nabonidus concerning Khammurabi's
  date, Peiser proposed to emend the figure given by the Kings' List for
  the length of Dynasty III. The reading of "9 soss and 36 years," which
  gives the total 576 years, he suggested was a scribal error for "6 soss
  and 39 years"; he thus reduced the length of Dynasty III. by 177 years
  and effected a corresponding reduction in the dates assigned to Dynasties
  I. and II.<a name="FnAnchor_0913"
  href="#Footnote_0913"><sup>[13]</sup></a> In 1897 Rost followed up
  Peiser's suggestion by reducing the figure still further, but he
  counteracted to some extent the effects of this additional reduction by
  emending Sennacherib's date for Marduk-nadin-akh&#x113;'s defeat of
  Tiglath-pileser I. as engraved on the rock at Bavian, holding that the
  figure "418," as engraved upon the rock, was a mistake for "478."<a
  name="FnAnchor_0914" href="#Footnote_0914"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
  Lehmann-Haupt's first system (1898) resembled those of Oppert, Sayce,
  Rogers, Winckler, Delitzsch and Maspero in that he accepted the figures
  of the Kings' List, and did not attempt to emend them. But he obtained
  his low date for the close of Dynasty III. by emending <!-- Page 110
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>[v.03
  p.0110]</span>Sennacherib's figure in the Bavian inscription; this he
  reduced by a hundred years,<a name="FnAnchor_0915"
  href="#Footnote_0915"><sup>[15]</sup></a> instead of increasing it by
  sixty as Rost had suggested. Lehmann-Haupt's influence is visible in
  Marquart's system, published in the following year;<a
  name="FnAnchor_0916" href="#Footnote_0916"><sup>[16]</sup></a> it may be
  noted that his slightly reduced figure for the beginning of Dynasty I.
  was arrived at by incorporating the new information supplied by the first
  date-list to be published. When revising his scheme of chronology in
  1900, Rost abandoned his suggested emendation of Sennacherib's figure,
  but by decreasing his reduction of the length of Dynasty III., he only
  altered his date for the beginning of Dynasty I. by one year.<a
  name="FnAnchor_0917" href="#Footnote_0917"><sup>[17]</sup></a> In his
  revised scheme of chronology, published in 1903,<a name="FnAnchor_0918"
  href="#Footnote_0918"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Lehmann-Haupt retained his
  emendation of Sennacherib's figure, and was in his turn influenced by
  Marquart's method of reconciling the dynasties of Berossus with the
  Kings' List. He continued to accept the figure of the Kings' List for
  Dynasty III., but he reduced the length of Dynasty II. by fifty years,
  arguing that the figures assigned to some of the reigns were improbably
  high. His slight reduction in the length of Dynasty I. was obtained from
  the recently published date-lists, though his proposed reduction of
  Ammizaduga's reign to ten years has since been disproved.</p>

  <p>A third group of systems comprises those proposed by Hommel and
  Niebuhr, for their reductions in the date assigned to Dynasty I. were
  effected chiefly by their treatment of Dynasty II. In his first system,
  published in 1886,<a name="FnAnchor_0919"
  href="#Footnote_0919"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Hommel, mainly with the object
  of reducing Khammurabi's date, reversed the order of the first two
  dynasties of the Kings' List, placing Dynasty II. before Dynasty I. In
  his second and third systems (1895 and 1898),<a name="FnAnchor_0920"
  href="#Footnote_0920"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and in his second alternative
  scheme of 1901 (see below), he abandoned this proposal and adopted a
  suggestion of Halévy that Dynasty III. followed immediately after Dynasty
  I.; Dynasty II., he suggested, had either synchronized with Dynasty I.,
  or was mainly apocryphal (<i>eine spätere Geschichtskonstruction</i>).
  Niebuhr's system was a modification of Hommel's second theory, for,
  instead of entirely ignoring Dynasty II., he reduced its independent
  existence to 143 years, making it overlap Dynasty I. by 225 years.<a
  name="FnAnchor_0921" href="#Footnote_0921"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The
  extremely low dates proposed by Hommel in 1898 were due to his adoption
  of Peiser's emendation for the length of Dynasty III., in addition to his
  own elimination of Dynasty II. In 1901 Hommel abandoned Peiser's
  emendation and suggested two alternative schemes.<a name="FnAnchor_0922"
  href="#Footnote_0922"><sup>[22]</sup></a> According to one of these he
  attempted to reconcile Berossus with the Kings' List by assigning to
  Dynasty II. an independent existence of some 171 years, while as a
  possible alternative he put forward what was practically his theory of
  1895.</p>

  <p>Such are the principles underlying the various chronological schemes
  which had, until recently, been propounded. The balance of opinion was in
  favour of those of the first group of writers, who avoided emendations of
  the figures and were content to follow the Kings' List and to ignore its
  apparent discrepancies with other chronological data; but it is now
  admitted that the general principle underlying the third group of
  theories was actually nearer the truth. The publication of fresh
  chronological material in 1906 and 1907 placed a new complexion on the
  problems at issue, and enabled us to correct several preconceptions, and
  to reconcile or explain the apparently conflicting data.</p>

  <p>From a Babylonian chronicle in the British Museum<a
  name="FnAnchor_0923" href="#Footnote_0923"><sup>[23]</sup></a> we now
  know that Dynasty II. of the Kings' List never occupied the throne of
  Babylon, but ruled only in the extreme south of Babylonia on the shores
  of the Persian Gulf; that its kings were contemporaneous with the later
  kings of Dynasty I. and with the earlier kings of Dynasty III. of the
  Kings' List; that in the reign of Samsu-ditana, the last king of Dynasty
  I., Hittites from Cappadocia raided and captured Babylon, which in her
  weakened state soon fell a prey to the Kassites (Dynasty III.); and that
  later on southern Babylonia, till then held by Dynasty II. of the Kings'
  List, was in its turn captured by the Kassites, who from that time onward
  occupied the whole of the Babylonian plain. The same chronicle informs us
  that Ilu-sh&#x16B;ma, an early Assyrian patesi, was the contemporary of
  Su-abu, the founder of Dynasty I. of the Kings' List, thus enabling us to
  trace the history of Assyria back beyond the rise of Babylon.</p>

  <p>Without going into details, the more important results of this new
  information may be summarized: the elimination of Dynasty II. from the
  throne of Babylon points to a date not much earlier than 2000 or 2050
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> for the rise of Dynasty I., a date which
  harmonizes with the chronological notices of Shalmaneser I.; Nabonidus's
  estimate of the period of Khammurabi, so far from being centuries too
  low, is now seen to have been exaggerated, as the context of the passage
  in his inscription suggests; and finally the beginning of the historical
  period of Berossus is not to be synchronized with Dynasty I. of the
  Kings' List, but, assuming that his figures had an historical basis and
  that they have come down to us in their original form, with some earlier
  dynasty which may possibly have had its capital in one of the other great
  cities of Babylonia (such as the Dynasty of Isin).</p>

  <p>New data have also been discovered bearing upon the period before the
  rise of Babylon. A fragment of an early dynastic chronicle from Nippur<a
  name="FnAnchor_0924" href="#Footnote_0924"><sup>[24]</sup></a> gives a
  list of the kings of the dynasties of Ur and Isin. From this text we
  learn that the Dynasty of Ur consisted of five kings and lasted for 117
  years, and was succeeded by the Dynasty of Isin, which consisted of
  sixteen kings and lasted for 225½ years. Now the capture of the city of
  Isin by R&#x12B;m-Sin, which took place in the seventeenth year of
  Sin-muballit, the father of Khammurabi, formed an epoch for dating
  tablets in certain parts of Babylonia,<a name="FnAnchor_0925"
  href="#Footnote_0925"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and it is probable that we may
  identify the fall of the Dynasty of Isin with this capture of the city.
  In that case the later rulers of the Dynasty of Isin would have been
  contemporaneous with the earlier rulers of Dynasty I. of the Kings' List,
  and we obtain for the rise of the Dynasty of Ur a date not much earlier
  than 2300 <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p>These considerable reductions in the dates of the earlier dynasties of
  Babylonia necessarily react upon our estimate of the age of Babylonian
  civilization. The very high dates of 5000 or 6000 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, formerly assigned by many writers to the
  earliest remains of the Sumerians and the Babylonian Semites,<a
  name="FnAnchor_0926" href="#Footnote_0926"><sup>[26]</sup></a> depended
  to a great extent on the statement of Nabonidus that 3200 years separated
  his own age from that of Nar&#x101;m-Sin, the son of Sargon of Agade; for
  to Sargon, on this statement alone, a date of 3800 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> has usually been assigned. But even by
  postulating the highest possible dates for the Dynasties of Babylon and
  Ur, enormous gaps occurred in the scheme of chronology, which were
  unrepresented by any royal name or record. In his valiant attempt to fill
  these gaps Radau was obliged to invent kings and even dynasties,<a
  name="FnAnchor_0927" href="#Footnote_0927"><sup>[27]</sup></a> the
  existence of which is now definitely disproved. The statement of
  Nabonidus has not, however, been universally accepted. Lehmann-Haupt
  suggested an emendation of the text, reducing the number by a thousand
  years;<a name="FnAnchor_0928" href="#Footnote_0928"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
  while Winckler has regarded the statement of Nabonidus as an uncritical
  exaggeration.<a name="FnAnchor_0929"
  href="#Footnote_0929"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Obviously the scribes of
  Nabonidus were not anxious to diminish the antiquity of the
  foundation-inscription of Nar&#x101;m-Sin, which their royal master had
  unearthed; <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>[v.03 p.0111]</span>and another reason for their
  calculations resulting in so high a figure is suggested by the recent
  discoveries: they may in all good faith have reckoned as consecutive a
  number of early dynasties which were as a matter of fact contemporaneous.
  But, though we may refuse to accept the accuracy of this figure of
  Nabonidus, it is not possible at present to fix a definite date for the
  early kings of Agade. All that can be said is that both archaeological
  and epigraphic evidence indicates that no very long interval separated
  the empire of the Semitic kings of Agade from that of the kings of Sumer
  and Akkad, whose rule was inaugurated by the founding of the Dynasty of
  Ur.<a name="FnAnchor_0930" href="#Footnote_0930"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To use caution in accepting the chronological notices of the later
  kings is very far removed from suggesting emendations of their figures.
  The emenders postulate mechanical errors in the writing of the figures,
  but, equally with those who accept them, regard the calculations of the
  native scribes as above reproach. But that scribes could make mistakes in
  their reckoning is definitely proved by the discovery at Shergat of two
  totally conflicting accounts of the age and history of the great temple
  of Assur.<a name="FnAnchor_0931"
  href="#Footnote_0931"><sup>[31]</sup></a> This discovery in itself
  suggests that all chronological data are not to be treated as of equal
  value and arranged mechanically like the pieces of a Chinese puzzle; and
  further, that no more than a provisional acceptance should be accorded
  any statement of the later native chronologists, until confirmed by
  contemporary records. On the other hand, the death-blow has been given to
  the principle of emendation of the figures, which for so long has found
  favour among a considerable body of German writers.</p>

  <p>(L. W. K.)</p>

  <p>IX. <i>Proper Names.</i>&mdash;In the early days of the decipherment
  of the cuneiform inscriptions, the reading of the proper names borne by
  Babylonians and Assyrians occasioned great difficulties; and though most
  of these difficulties have been overcome and there is general agreement
  among scholars as to the principles underlying both the formation and the
  pronunciation of the thousands of names that we encounter in historical
  records, business documents, votive inscriptions and literary
  productions, differences, though mostly of a minor character, still
  remain. Some time must elapse before absolute uniformity in the
  transliteration of these proper names is to be expected; and since
  different scholars still adopt varying spellings of Babylonian and
  Assyrian proper names, it has been considered undesirable in this work to
  ignore the fact in individual articles contributed by them. The better
  course seems to be to explain here the nature of these variations.</p>

  <p>The main difficulty in the reading of Babylonian and Assyrian proper
  names arises from the preference given to the "ideographic" method of
  writing them. According to the developed cuneiform system of writing,
  words may be written by means of a sign (or combination of signs)
  expressive of the entire word, or they may be spelled out phonetically in
  syllables. So, for example, the word for "name" may be written by a sign
  MU, or it may be written cut by two signs <i>shu-mu</i>, the one sign MU
  representing the "Sumerian" word for "name," which, however, in the case
  of a Babylonian or Assyrian text must be read as <i>shumu</i>&mdash;the
  Semitic equivalent of the Sumerian MU. Similarly the word for "clothing"
  may be written SIG-BA, which represents again the "Sumerian" word,
  whereas, the Babylonian-Assyrian equivalent being <i>lubushtu</i> it is
  so to be read in Semitic texts, and may therefore be also phonetically
  written <i>lu-bu-ush-tu</i>. This double method of writing words arises
  from the circumstance that the cuneiform syllabary is of non-Semitic
  origin, the system being derived from the non-Semitic settlers of the
  Euphrates valley, commonly termed Sumerians (or Sumero-Akkadians), to
  whom, as the earlier settlers, the origin of the cuneiform script is due.
  This script, together with the general Sumerian culture, was taken over
  by the Babylonians upon their settlement in the Euphrates valley and
  adapted to their language, which belonged to the Semitic group. In this
  transfer the Sumerian words&mdash;largely monosyllabic&mdash;were
  reproduced, but read as Semitic, and at the same time the advance step
  was taken of utilizing the Sumerian words as means of writing the
  Babylonian words phonetically. In this case the signs representing
  Sumerian words were treated merely as syllables, and, without reference
  to their meaning, utilized for spelling Babylonian words. The Babylonian
  syllabary which thus arose, and which, as the culture passed on to the
  north&mdash;known as Assyria&mdash;became the Babylonian Assyrian
  syllabary,<a name="FnAnchor_0932"
  href="#Footnote_0932"><sup>[32]</sup></a> was enlarged and modified in
  the course of time, the Semitic equivalents for many of the signs being
  distorted or abbreviated to form the basis of new "phonetic" values that
  were thus of "Semitic" origin; but, on the whole, the "non-Semitic"
  character of the signs used as syllables in the phonetic method of
  writing Semitic words was preserved; and, furthermore, down to the latest
  days of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires the mixed method of writing
  continued, though there were periods when "purism" was the fashion, and
  there was a more marked tendency to spell out the words laboriously in
  preference to using signs with a phonetic complement as an aid in
  suggesting the reading desired in any given instance. Yet, even in those
  days, the Babylonian syllabary continued to be a mixture of ideographic
  and phonetic writing. Besides the conventional use of certain signs as
  the indications of names of gods, countries, cities, vessels, birds,
  trees, &amp;c., which, known as "determinants," are the Sumerian signs of
  the terms in question and were added as a guide for the reader, proper
  names more particularly continued to be written to a large extent in
  purely "ideographic" fashion. The conservatism which is a feature of
  proper names everywhere, in consequence of which the archaic traits of a
  language are frequently preserved in them, just as they are preserved in
  terms used in the ritual and in poetic diction, is sufficient to account
  for the interesting fact that the Semitic settlers of the Euphrates
  valley in handing down their names from one generation to another
  retained the custom of writing them in "Sumerian" fashion, or, as we
  might also put it, in "ideographic" form. Thus the name of the deity,
  which enters as an element in a large proportion of the proper names,<a
  name="FnAnchor_0933" href="#Footnote_0933"><sup>[33]</sup></a> was almost
  invariably written with the sign or signs representing this deity, and it
  is only exceptionally that the name is spelled phonetically. Thus the
  name of the chief god of the Babylonian pantheon, Marduk, is written by
  two signs to be pronounced AMAR-UD, which describe the god as the "young
  bullock of the day"&mdash;an allusion to the solar character of the god
  in question. The moon-god Sin is written by a sign which has the force of
  "thirty," and is a distinct reference to the monthly course of the
  planet; or the name is written by two signs to be pronounced EN-ZU, which
  describe the god as the "lord of wisdom." The god Nebo appears as
  PA&mdash;the sign of the stylus, which is associated with this deity as
  the originator and patron of writing and of knowledge in
  general,&mdash;or it is written with a sign AK, which describes the god
  as a "creator."</p>

  <p>Until, therefore, through parallel passages or through explanatory
  lists prepared by the Babylonian and Assyrian scribes in large numbers as
  an aid for the study of the language,<a name="FnAnchor_0934"
  href="#Footnote_0934"><sup>[34]</sup></a> the exact phonetic reading of
  these divine names was determined, scholars remained in doubt or had
  recourse to conjectural or provisional readings. Even at the present time
  there are many names of deities, as, <i>e.g.</i> Ninib, the phonetic
  reading of which is still unknown or uncertain. In most cases, however,
  these belong to the category of minor deities or represent old local gods
  assimilated to some more powerful god, who absorbed, as it were, the
  attributes and prerogatives of these minor ones. In many cases they will
  probably turn out to be descriptive epithets of gods <!-- Page 112
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[v.03
  p.0112]</span>already known rather than genuine proper names. A peculiar
  difficulty arises in the case of the god of storms, who, written IM, was
  generally known in Babylonia as Ramman, "the thunderer," whereas in
  Assyria he also had the designation Adad. In many cases, therefore, we
  may be in doubt how the sign IM is to be read, more particularly since
  this same god appears to have had other designations besides Ramman and
  Adad.</p>

  <p>Besides the divine element, proper names as a rule in the
  Babylonian-Assyrian periods had a verbal form attached and a third
  element representing an object. Even when the sign indicative of the verb
  is clearly recognised there still remains to be determined the form of
  the verb intended. Thus in the case of the sign KUR, which is the
  equivalent of <span class="special"
  title="nasaru"><i>na&#x1E63;&#x101;ru</i></span>, "protect," there is the
  possibility of reading it as the active participle <span class="special"
  title="nasir"><i>n&#x101;&#x1E63;ir</i></span>, or as an imperative <span
  class="special" title="ussur"><i>u&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ur</i></span>, or even
  the third person perfect <span class="special"
  title="issur"><i>i&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ur</i></span>. Similarly in the case of
  the sign MU, which, besides signifying "name" as above pointed out, is
  also the Sumerian word for "give," and therefore may be read
  <i>iddin</i>, "he gave," from <i>nad&#x101;nu</i>, or may be read
  <i>n&#x101;din</i>, "giver"; and when, as actually happens, a name occurs
  in which the first element is the name of a deity followed by MU-MU, a
  new element of doubt is introduced through the uncertainty whether the
  first MU is to be taken as a form of the verb <i>nad&#x101;nu</i> and the
  second as the noun <i>shumu</i>, "name," or vice versa.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, in the case of a large number of names occurring on
  business documents as the interested parties or as scribes or as
  witnesses&mdash;and it is through these documents that we obtain the
  majority of the Babylonian-Assyrian proper names&mdash;we have variant
  readings, the same name being written phonetically in whole or part in
  one instance and ideographically in another. Certain classes of names
  being explained in this way, legitimate and fairly reliable conclusions
  can be drawn for many others belonging to the same class or group. The
  proper names of the numerous business documents of the Khammurabi period,
  when phonetic writing was the fashion, have been of special value in
  resolving doubts as to the correct reading of names written
  ideographically. Thus names like <i>Sin-na-di-in-shu-mi</i> and
  <i>Bel-na-di-in-shu-mi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "Sin is the giver of a name"
  (<i>i.e.</i> offspring), and "Bel is the giver of a name," form the model
  for names with deities as the first element followed by MU-MU, even
  though the model may not be consistently followed in all cases. In
  historical texts also variant readings occur in considerable number.
  Thus, to take a classic example, the name of the famous king
  Nebuchadrezzar occurs written in the following different
  manners:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <span class="special"
  title="Na-bi-um-ku-du-ur-ri-u-su-ur"><i>Na-bi-um-ku-du-ur-ri-u-&#x1E63;u-ur</i></span>,
  (<i>b</i>) <span class="special"
  title="AK-DU-u-su-ur">AK-DU-<i>u-&#x1E63;u-ur</i></span>, (<i>c</i>)
  AK-<i>ku-dur-ri</i>-SHES, and (<i>d</i>) PA-GAR-DU-SHES, from which we
  are permitted to conclude that PA or AK (with the determinative for deity
  AN) = <i>Na-bi-um</i> or Nebo, that GAR-DU or DU alone = <i>kudurri</i>,
  and that SHES = <span class="special"
  title="ussur"><i>u&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ur</i></span>. The second element
  signifies "boundary" or "territory"; the third element is the imperative
  of <i>nasaru</i>, "protect"; so that the whole name signifies, "O, Nebo!
  protect my boundary" (or "my territory").</p>

  <p>It is not the purpose of this note to set forth the principles
  underlying the formation of proper names among the Babylonians and
  Assyrians, but it may not be out of place to indicate that by the side of
  such full names, containing three elements (or even more), we have
  already at an early period the reduction of these elements to two through
  the combination of the name of a deity with a verbal form merely, or
  through the omission of the name of the deity. From such names it is only
  a step to names of one element, a characteristic feature of which is the
  frequent addition of an ending <i>-tum</i> (feminine), <i>&#x101;n</i>,
  <i>&#x101;</i>, <i>um</i>, <i>atum</i>, <i>atija</i>, <i>sha,</i>
  &amp;c., most of these being "hypocoristic affixes," corresponding in a
  measure to modern pet-names.</p>

  <p>Lastly, a word about genuine or pseudo-Sumerian names. In the case of
  texts from the oldest historical periods we encounter hundreds of names
  that are genuinely Sumerian, and here in view of the multiplicity of the
  phonetic values attaching to the signs used it is frequently difficult
  definitely to determine the reading of the names. Our knowledge of the
  ancient Sumerian language is still quite imperfect, despite the
  considerable progress made, more particularly during recent years. It is
  therefore not surprising that scholars should differ considerably in the
  reading of Sumerian names, where we have not helps at our command as for
  Babylonian and Assyrian names. Changes in the manner of reading the
  Sumerian names are frequent. Thus the name of a king of Ur, generally
  read Ur-Bau until quite recently, is now read Ur-Engur; for
  Lugal-zaggisi, a king of Erech, some scholars still prefer to read
  Ungal-zaggisi; the name of a famous political and religious centre
  generally read Shir-pur-la is more probably to be read Shir-gul-la; and
  so forth. There is reason, however, to believe that the uncertainty in
  regard to many of these names will eventually be resolved into reasonable
  certainty. A doubt also still exists in regard to a number of names of
  the older period because of the uncertainty whether their bearers were
  Sumerians or Semites. If the former, then their names are surely to be
  read as Sumerian, while, if they were Semites, the signs with which the
  names are written are probably to be read according to their Semitic
  equivalents, though we may also expect to encounter Semites bearing
  genuine Sumerian names. At times too a doubt may exist in regard to a
  name whose bearer was a Semite, whether the signs composing his name
  represent a phonetic reading or an ideographic compound. Thus,
  <i>e.g.</i> when inscriptions of a Semitic ruler of Kish, whose name was
  written Uru-mu-ush, were first deciphered, there was a disposition to
  regard this as an ideographic form and to read phonetically Alu-usharshid
  ("he founded a city," with the omission of the name of the deity), but
  scholarly opinion finally accepted Uru-mu-ush (Urumush) as the correct
  designation.</p>

  <p>For further details regarding the formation of Sumerian and
  Babylonian-Assyrian proper names, as well as for an indication of the
  problems involved and the difficulties still existing, especially in the
  case of Sumerian names,<a name="FnAnchor_0935"

  <p><b>BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN RELIGION.</b> The development of the
  religion of Babylonia, so far as it can be traced with the material at
  hand, follows closely along the lines of the periods to be distinguished
  in the history of the Euphrates valley. Leaving aside the primitive
  phases of the religion as lying beyond the ken of historical
  investigation, we may note the sharp distinction to be made between the
  pre-Khammurabic age and the post-Khammurabic age. While the political
  movement represented by Khammurabi may have been proceeding for some time
  prior to the appearance of the great conqueror, the period of <i>c.</i>
  2250 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the union of the Euphratean
  states was effected by Khammurabi, marks the beginning of a new epoch in
  the religion as well as in the political history of the Euphrates valley.
  Corresponding to the states into which we find the country divided before
  2250 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, we have a various number of
  religious centres such as Nippur, Erech, Kutha (Cuthah), Ur, Sippara
  (Sippar), Shirgulla (Lagash), Eridu and Agade, in each of which some god
  was looked upon as the chief deity around whom there were gathered a
  number of minor deities and with whom there was invariably associated a
  female consort. The jurisdiction of this chief god was, however, limited
  to the political extent or control of the district in which the main seat
  of the cult of the deity in question lay. Mild attempts, to be sure, to
  group the chief deities associated with the most important religious and
  political centres into a regular pantheon were made&mdash;notably in
  Nippur and later in Ur&mdash;but such attempts lacked the enduring
  quality which attaches to Khammurabi's avowed policy to raise
  Marduk&mdash;the patron deity of the future capital, Babylon&mdash;to the
  head of the entire Babylonian pantheon, as <!-- Page 113 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[v.03 p.0113]</span>Babylon itself
  came to be recognized as the real centre of the entire Euphrates
  valley.</p>

  <p>Associated with Marduk was his consort Sarpanit, and grouped around
  the pair as princes around a throne were the chief deities of the older
  centres, like Ea and Damkina of Eridu, Nebo and Tashmit of Borsippa,
  Nergal and Allatu of Kutha, Shamash and &#x100; of Sippar, Sin and Ningal
  of Ur, as well as pairs like Ramman (or Adad) and Shala whose central
  seat is unknown to us. In this process of accommodating ancient
  prerogatives to new conditions, it was inevitable that attributes
  belonging specifically to the one or the other of these gods should have
  been transferred to Marduk, who thus from being, originally, a solar
  deity becomes an eclectic power, taking on the traits of Bel, Ea,
  Shamash, Nergal, Adad and even Sin (the moon-god)&mdash;a kind of
  composite residuum of all the chief gods.</p>

  <p>In the religious literature this process can be traced with perfect
  definiteness. The older incantations, associated with Ea, were re-edited
  so as to give to Marduk the supreme power over demons, witches and
  sorcerers: the hymns and lamentations composed for the cult of Bel,
  Shamash and of Adad were transformed into paeans and appeals to Marduk,
  while the ancient myths arising in the various religious and political
  centres underwent a similar process of adaptation to changed conditions,
  and as a consequence their original meaning was obscured by the endeavour
  to assign all mighty deeds and acts, originally symbolical of the change
  of seasons or of occurrences in nature, to the patron deity of
  Babylon&mdash;the supreme head of the entire Babylonian pantheon. Besides
  the chief deities and their consorts, various minor ones, representing
  likewise patron gods of less important localities and in most cases of a
  solar character were added at one time or the other to the court of
  Marduk, though there is also to be noted a tendency on the part of the
  chief solar deity, Shamash of Sippara, and for the chief moon-god to
  absorb the solar and lunar deities of less important sites, leading in
  the case of the solar gods to the differentiation of the functions of
  Shamash during the various seasons of the year and the various times of
  the day among these minor deities. In this way Ninib, whose chief seat
  appears to have been at Shirgulla (Lagash), became the sun-god of the
  springtime and of the morning, bringing joy and new life to the earth,
  while Nergal of Kutha was regarded as the sun of the summer solstice and
  of the noonday heat&mdash;the harbinger of suffering and death.</p>

  <p>There were, however, two deities who appear to have retained an
  independent existence&mdash;Anu (<i>q.v.</i>), the god of heaven, and
  Ishtar (<i>q.v.</i>), the great mother-goddess, who symbolized fertility
  and vitality in general. There are some reasons for believing that the
  oldest seat, and possibly the original seat, of the Anu cult was in
  Erech, as it is there where the Ishtar cult that subsequently spread
  throughout Babylonia and Assyria took its rise. While Anu, with whom
  there was associated as a pale reflection a consort Antum, assigned to
  him under the influence of the widely prevalent view among the early
  Semites which conceived of gods always in pairs, remained more or less of
  an abstraction during the various periods of the Babylonian-Assyrian
  religion and taking little part in the active cult of the temples, his
  unique position as the chief god of the highest heavens was always
  recognized in the theological system developed by the priests, which
  found an expression in making him the first figure of a triad, consisting
  of Anu, Bel and Ea, among whom the priests divided the three divisions of
  the universe, the heavens, the earth with the atmosphere above it, and
  the watery expanse respectively.</p>

  <p>Postponing the discussion of this triad, it is to be noted that the
  systematization of the pantheon after the days of Khammurabi did not
  seriously interfere with the independence of the goddess Ishtar. While
  frequently associated with Marduk, and still more closely with the chief
  god of Assyria, the god Assur (who occupies in the north the position
  accorded to Marduk in the south), so much so as to be sometimes spoken of
  as Assur's consort&mdash;the lady or Belit <i>par
  excellence</i>&mdash;the belief that as the source of all life she stands
  apart never lost its hold upon the people and found an expression also in
  the system devised by the priests. By the side of the first triad,
  consisting of Anu, Bel and Ea&mdash;disconnected in this form entirely
  from all local associations&mdash;we encounter a second triad composed of
  Shamash, Sin and Ishtar. As the first triad symbolized the three
  divisions of the universe&mdash;the heavens, earth and the watery
  element&mdash;so the second represented the three great forces of
  nature&mdash;the sun, the moon and the life-giving power. According as
  the one or the other aspect of such a power is brought into the
  foreground, Ishtar becomes the mother of mankind, the fertile earth, the
  goddess of sexual love, and the creative force among animals, while at
  times she appears in hymns and myths as the general personification of
  nature.</p>

  <p>We thus find in the post-Khammurabic period the pantheon assuming
  distinct shapes. The strong tendency towards concentrating in one
  deity&mdash;Marduk&mdash;the attributes of all others was offset by the
  natural desire to make the position of Marduk accord with the rank
  acquired by the secular rulers. As these emphasized their supremacy by
  grouping around them a court of loyal attendants dependent in rank and
  ready to do their master's bidding, so the gods of the chief centres and
  those of the minor local cults formed a group around Marduk; and the
  larger the group the greater was the reflected glory of the chief figure.
  Hence throughout the subsequent periods of Babylonian history, and
  despite a decided progress towards a monotheistic conception of divine
  government of the universe, the recognition of a large number of gods and
  their consorts by the side of Marduk remained a firmly embedded doctrine
  in the Babylonian religion as it did in the Assyrian religion, with the
  important variation, however, of transferring the rôle of the head of the
  pantheon from Marduk to Assur. Originally the patron god of the city of
  Assur (<i>q.v.</i>), when this city became the centre of a growing and
  independent district, Assur was naturally advanced to the same position
  in the north that Marduk occupied in the south. The religious
  predominance of the city of Babylon served to maintain for Marduk
  recognition even on the part of the Assyrian rulers, who, on the
  political side likewise, conceded to Babylonia the form at least of an
  independent district even when, as kings of Assyria, they exercised
  absolute control over it. They appointed their sons or brothers governors
  of Babylonia, and in the long array of titles that the kings gave
  themselves, a special phrase was always set aside to indicate their
  mastery over Babylonia. "To take the hand of Bel-Marduk" was the ceremony
  of installation which Assyrian rulers recognized equally with Babylonians
  as an essential preliminary to exercising authority in the Euphrates
  valley. Marduk and Assur became rivals only when Babylonia gave the
  Assyrians trouble; and when in 689 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  Sennacherib, whose patience had been exhausted by the difficulties
  encountered in maintaining peace in the south, actually besieged and
  destroyed the city of Babylon, he removed the statue of Marduk to Nineveh
  as a symbol that the god's rule had come to an end. His grandson
  Assur-bani-pal, with a view of re-establishing amicable relations,
  restored the statue to the temple E-Saggila in Babylon and performed the
  time-honoured ceremony of "taking the hand of Bel" as a symbol of his
  homage to the ancient head of the Babylonian pantheon.</p>

  <p>But for the substitution of Assur for Marduk, the Assyrian pantheon
  was the same as that set up in the south, though some of the gods were
  endowed with attributes which differ slightly from those which mark the
  same gods in the south. The warlike nature of the Assyrians was reflected
  in their conceptions of the gods, who thus became little Assurs by the
  side of the great protector of arms, the big Assur. The cult and ritual
  in the north likewise followed the models set up in the south. The hymns
  composed for the temples of Babylonia were transferred to Assur, Calah,
  Harran, Arbela and Nineveh in the north; and the myths and legends also
  wandered to Assyria, where, to be sure, they underwent certain
  modifications. To all practical purposes, however, the religion of
  Assyria was identical with that practised in the south.</p>

  <p>We thus obtain four periods in the development of the
  Babylonian-Assyrian religion: (1) the oldest period from <!-- Page 114
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[v.03
  p.0114]</span><i>c.</i> 3500 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to the time
  of Khammurabi (<i>c.</i> 2250 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>); (2) the
  post-Khammurabic period in Babylonia; (3) the Assyrian period (<i>c.</i>
  2000 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) to the destruction of Nineveh in 606
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>; (4) the neo-Babylonian period beginning
  with Nabopolassar (625-604 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), the first
  independent ruler under whom Babylonia inaugurates a new though
  short-lived era of power and prosperity, which ends with Cyrus's conquest
  of Babylon and Babylonia in 539 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, though
  since the religion proceeds on its undisturbed course for several
  centuries after the end of the political independence, we might
  legitimately carry this period to the Greek conquest of the Euphrates
  valley (331 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), when new influences began to
  make themselves felt which gradually led to the extinction of the old
  cults.</p>

  <p>In this long period of <i>c.</i> 3500 to <i>c.</i> 300 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, the changes introduced after the adjustment to
  the new conditions produced by Khammurabi's union of the Euphratean
  states are of a minor character. As already indicated, the local cults in
  the important centres of the south and north maintained themselves
  despite the tendency towards centralization, and while the cults
  themselves varied according to the character of the gods worshipped in
  each centre, the general principles were the same and the rites differed
  in minor details rather than in essential variations. An important factor
  which thus served to maintain the rites in a more or less stable
  condition was the predominance of what may be called the astral theology
  as the theoretical substratum of the Babylonian religion, and which is
  equally pronounced in the religious system of Assyria. The essential
  feature of this astral theology is the assumption of a close link between
  the movements going on in the heavens and occurrences on earth, which led
  to identifying the gods and goddesses with heavenly bodies&mdash;planets
  and stars, besides sun and moon&mdash;and to assigning the seats of all
  the deities in the heavens. The personification of the two great
  luminaries&mdash;the sun and the moon&mdash;was the first step in the
  unfolding of this system, and this was followed by placing the other
  deities where Shamash and Sin had their seats. This process, which
  reached its culmination in the post-Khammurabic period, led to
  identifying the planet Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, Mars with
  Nergal, Mercury with Nebo, and Saturn with Ninib. The system represents a
  harmonious combination of two factors, one of popular origin, the other
  the outcome of speculation in the schools attached to the temples of
  Babylonia. The popular factor is the belief in the influence exerted by
  the movements of the heavenly bodies on occurrences on earth&mdash;a
  belief naturally suggested by the dependence of life, vegetation and
  guidance upon the two great luminaries. Starting with this belief the
  priests built up the theory of the close correspondence between
  occurrences on earth and phenomena in the heavens. The heavens presenting
  a constant change even to the superficial observer, the conclusion was
  drawn of a connexion between the changes and the ever-changing movement
  in the fate of individuals and of nature as well as in the appearance of
  nature.</p>

  <p>To read the signs of the heavens was therefore to understand the
  meaning of occurrences on earth, and with this accomplished it was also
  possible to foretell what events were portended by the position and
  relationship to one another of sun, moon, planets and certain stars.
  Myths that symbolized changes in season or occurrences in nature were
  projected on the heavens, which were mapped out to correspond to the
  divisions of the earth. All the gods, great and small, had their places
  assigned to them in the heavens, and facts, including such as fell within
  the domain of political history, were interpreted in terms of astral
  theology. So completely did this system in the course of time sway men's
  minds that the cult, from being an expression of animistic beliefs, took
  on the colour derived from the "astral" interpretation of occurrences and
  doctrines. It left its trace in incantations, omens and hymns, and it
  gave birth to astronomy, which was assiduously cultivated because a
  knowledge of the heavens was the very foundation of the system of belief
  unfolded by the priests of Babylonia and Assyria. "Chaldaean wisdom"
  became in the classical world the synonym of this science, which in its
  character was so essentially religious. The persistent prominence which
  astrology (<i>q.v.</i>) continued to enjoy down to the border line of the
  scientific movement of our own days, and which is directly traceable to
  the divination methods perfected in the Euphrates valley, is a tribute to
  the scope and influence attained by the astral theology of the Babylonian
  and Assyrian priests.</p>

  <p>As an illustration of the manner in which the doctrines of the
  religion were made to conform to the all-pervading astral theory, it will
  be sufficient to refer to the modification undergone in this process of
  the view developed in a very early period which apportioned the control
  of the universe among the three gods Anu, Bel and Ea. Disassociating
  these gods from all local connexions, Anu became the power presiding over
  the heavens, to Bel was assigned the earth and the atmosphere immediately
  above it, while Ea ruled over the deep. With the transfer of all the gods
  to the heavens, and under the influence of the doctrine of the
  correspondence between the heavens and the earth, Anu, Bel and Ea became
  the three "ways" (as they are called) on the heavens. The "ways" appear
  in this instance to have been the designation of the ecliptic circle,
  which was divided into three sections or zones&mdash;a northern, a middle
  and a southern zone, Anu being assigned to the first, Bel to the second,
  and Ea to the third zone. The astral theology of the Babylonian-Assyrian
  religion, while thus bearing the ear-marks of a system devised by the
  priests, succeeded in assimilating the beliefs which represented the
  earlier attempts to systematize the more popular aspects of the religion,
  and in this way a unification of diverse elements was secured that led to
  interpreting the contents and the form of the religion in terms of the
  astral-theological system.</p>

  <p>The most noteworthy outcome of this system in the realm of religious
  practice was, as already intimated, the growth of an elaborate and
  complicated method of divining the future by the observation of the
  phenomena in the heavens. It is significant that in the royal collection
  of cuneiform literature made by King Assur-bani-pal of Assyria (668-626
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) and deposited in his palace at Nineveh,
  the omen collections connected with the astral theology of Babylonia and
  Assyria form the largest class. There are also indications that the
  extensive texts dealing with divination through the liver of sacrificial
  animals, which represents a more popular origin than divination through
  the observations of the heavens, based as it is on the primitive view
  which regarded the liver as the seat of life and of the soul, were
  brought into connexion with astral divination. Less influenced by the
  astral-theological system are the old incantation texts which were
  gathered together into series. In these series we can trace the attempt
  to gather the incantation formulae and prayers produced in different
  centres, and to make them conform to the tendency to centralize the cult
  in the worship of Marduk and his consort in the south, and of Assur and
  Ishtar in the north. Incantations originally addressed to Ea of Eridu, as
  the god of the watery element, and to Nusku, as the god of fire, were
  transferred to Marduk. This was done by making Ea confer on Marduk as his
  son the powers of the father, and by making Nusku a messenger between Ea
  and Marduk. At the same time, since the invoking of the divine powers was
  the essential element in the incantations, in order to make the magic
  formulae as effective as possible, a large number of the old local
  deities are introduced to add their power to the chief ones; and it is
  here that the astral system comes into play through the introduction of
  names of stars, as well as through assigning attributes to the gods which
  clearly reflect the conception that they have their seats in the heavens.
  The incantations pass over naturally into hymns and prayers. The
  connexion between the two is illustrated by the application of the term
  <i>shiptu</i>, "incantation," to the direct appeals to the gods, as well
  as by the introduction, on the one hand, of genuine prayers into the
  incantations and by the addition, on the other hand, of incantations to
  prayers and hymns, pure and simple. In another division of the religious
  literature of Babylonia which is largely represented in Assur-bani-pal's
  collection&mdash;the myths and legends&mdash;tales which originally
  symbolized the change of seasons, or in which historical occurrences are
  overcast with more or less copious <!-- Page 115 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[v.03 p.0115]</span>admixture of
  legend and myth, were transferred to the heavens, and so it happens that
  creation myths, and the accounts of wanderings and adventures of heroes
  of the past, are referred to movements among the planets and stars as
  well as to occurrences or supposed occurrences on earth.</p>

  <p>The ritual alone which accompanied divination practices and
  incantation formulae and was a chief factor in the celebration of
  festival days and of days set aside for one reason or the other to the
  worship of some god or goddess or group of deities, is free from traces
  of the astral theology. The more or less elaborate ceremonies prescribed
  for the occasions when the gods were approached are directly connected
  with the popular elements of the religion. Animal sacrifice, libations,
  ritualistic purification, sprinkling of water, and symbolical rites of
  all kinds accompanied by short prayers, represent a religious practice
  which in the Babylonian-Assyrian religion, as in all religions, is older
  than any theology and survives the changes which the theoretical
  substratum of the religion undergoes.</p>

  <p>On the ethical side, the religion of Babylonia more particularly, and
  to a less extent that of Assyria, advances to noticeable conceptions of
  the qualities associated with the gods and goddesses and of the duties
  imposed on man. Shamash the sun-god was invested with justice as his
  chief trait, Marduk is portrayed as full of mercy and kindness, Ea is the
  protector of mankind who is grieved when, through a deception practised
  upon Adapa, humanity is deprived of immortality. The gods, to be sure,
  are easily aroused to anger, and in some of them the dire aspects
  predominated, but the view becomes more and more pronounced that there is
  some cause always for the divine wrath. Though, in accounting for the
  anger of the gods, no sharp distinction is made between moral offences
  and a ritualistic oversight or neglect, yet the stress laid in the hymns
  and prayers, as well as in the elaborate atonement ritual prescribed in
  order to appease the anger of the gods, on the need of being clean and
  pure in the sight of the higher powers, the inculcation of a proper
  aspect of humility, and above all the need of confessing one's guilt and
  sins without any reserve&mdash;all this bears testimony to the strength
  which the ethical factor acquired in the domain of the religion.</p>

  <p>This factor appears to less advantage in the unfolding of the views
  concerning life after death. Throughout all periods of
  Babylonian-Assyrian history, the conception prevailed of a large dark
  cavern below the earth, not far from the Apsu&mdash;the ocean encircling
  and flowing underneath the earth&mdash;in which all the dead were
  gathered and where they led a miserable existence of inactivity amid
  gloom and dust. Occasionally a favoured individual was permitted to
  escape from this general fate and placed in a pleasant island. It would
  appear also that the rulers were always singled out for divine grace, and
  in the earlier periods of the history, owing to the prevailing view that
  the rulers stood nearer to the gods than other mortals, the kings were
  deified after death, and in some instances divine honours were paid to
  them even during their lifetime.</p>

  <p>The influence exerted by the Babylonian-Assyrian religion was
  particularly profound on the Semites, while the astral theology affected
  the ancient world in general, including the Greeks and Romans. The
  impetus to the purification of the old Semite religion to which the
  Hebrews for a long time clung in common with their fellows&mdash;the
  various branches of nomadic Arabs&mdash;was largely furnished by the
  remarkable civilization unfolded in the Euphrates valley and in many of
  the traditions, myths and legends embodied in the Old Testament; traces
  of direct borrowing from Babylonia may be discerned, while the indirect
  influences in the domain of the prophetical books, as also in the Psalms
  and in the so-called "Wisdom Literature," are even more noteworthy. Even
  when we reach the New Testament period, we have not passed entirely
  beyond the sphere of Babylonian-Assyrian influences. In such a movement
  as early Christian gnosticism, Babylonian elements&mdash;modified, to be
  sure, and transformed&mdash;are largely present, while the growth of an
  apocalyptic literature is ascribed with apparent justice by many scholars
  to the recrudescence of views the ultimate source of which is to be found
  in the astral-theology of the Babylonian and Assyrian priests.</p>

  <p><b>BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY,</b> the name generally given to the
  deportation of the Jews to Babylon by Nebuchadrezzar. Three separate
  occasions are mentioned (Jer. lii. 28-30). The first was in the time of
  Jehoiachin in 597 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the temple of
  Jerusalem was partially despoiled and a number of the leading citizens
  removed. After eleven years (in the reign of Zedekiah) a fresh rising of
  the Judaeans occurred; the city was razed to the ground, and a further
  deportation ensued. Finally, five years later, Jeremiah (<i>loc.
  cit.</i>) records a third captivity. After the overthrow of Babylonia by
  the Persians, Cyrus gave the Jews permission to return to their native
  land (537 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), and more then forty thousand
  are said to have availed themselves of the privilege. (See <span

  <p><b>BABYLONIAN LAW.</b> The material for the study of Babylonian law is
  singularly extensive without being exhaustive. The so-called "contracts,"
  including a great variety of deeds, conveyances, bonds, receipts,
  accounts and, most important of all, the actual legal decisions given by
  the judges in the law courts, exist in thousands. Historical
  inscriptions, royal charters and rescripts, despatches, private letters
  and the general literature afford welcome supplementary information. Even
  grammatical and lexicographical works, intended solely to facilitate the
  study of ancient literature, contain many extracts or short sentences
  bearing on law and custom. The so-called "Sumerian Family Laws" are thus
  preserved. The discovery of the now celebrated Code of Khammurabi
  (Hammurabi)<a name="FnAnchor_101" href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  (hereinafter simply termed <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[v.03 p.0116]</span>"the Code") has, however, made a
  more systematic study possible than could have resulted from the
  classification and interpretation of the other material. Some fragments
  of a later code exist and have been published; but there still remain
  many points upon which we have no evidence.</p>

  <p>This material dates from the earliest times down to the commencement
  of our era. The evidence upon a particular point may be very full at one
  period and almost entirely lacking at another. The Code forms the
  backbone of the skeleton sketch which is here reconstructed. The
  fragments of it which have been recovered from Assur-bani-pal's library
  at Nineveh and later Babylonian copies show that it was studied, divided
  into chapters entitled <span class="special" title="Ninu ilu sirum"
  ><i>Ninu ilu &#x1E63;irum</i></span> from its opening words, and recopied
  for fifteen hundred years or more. The greater part of it remained in
  force, even through the Persian, Greek and Parthian conquests, which
  affected private life in Babylonia very little, and it survived to
  influence Syro-Roman and later Mahommedan law in Mesopotamia. The law and
  custom which preceded the Code we shall call "early," that of the New
  Babylonian empire (as well as the Persian, Greek, &amp;c.) "late." The
  law in Assyria was derived from Babylonia but conserved early features
  long after they had disappeared elsewhere.</p>

  <p>When the Semitic tribes settled in the cities of Babylonia, their
  tribal custom passed over into city law. The early history of the country
  is the story of a struggle for supremacy between the cities. A metropolis
  demanded tribute and military support from its subject cities but left
  their local cults and customs unaffected. The city rights and usages were
  respected by kings and conquerors alike.</p>

  <p>As late as the accession of Assur-bani-pal and Samas-sum-yukin we find
  the Babylonians appealing to their city laws that groups of aliens to the
  number of twenty at a time were free to enter the city, that foreign
  women once married to Babylonian husbands could not be enslaved and that
  not even a dog that entered the city could be put to death untried.</p>

  <p>The population of Babylonia was of many races from early times and
  intercommunication between the cities was incessant. Every city had a
  large number of resident aliens. This freedom of intercourse must have
  tended to assimilate custom. It was, however, reserved for the genius of
  Khammurabi to make Babylon his metropolis and weld together his vast
  empire by a uniform system of law.</p>

  <p>Almost all trace of tribal custom has already disappeared <span
  class="sidenote">Code of Khammurabi.</span> from the law of the Code. It
  is state-law; alike self-help, blood-feud, marriage by capture, are
  absent; though family solidarity, district responsibility, ordeal, the
  <i>lex talionis</i>, are primitive features that remain. The king is a
  benevolent autocrat, easily accessible to all his subjects, both able and
  willing to protect the weak against the highest-placed oppressor. The
  royal power, however, can only pardon when private resentment is
  appeased. The judges are strictly supervised and appeal is allowed. The
  whole land is covered with feudal holdings, masters of the levy, police,
  &amp;c. There is a regular postal system. The <i>pax Babylonica</i> is so
  assured that private individuals do not hesitate to ride in their
  carriage from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean. The position of
  women is free and dignified.</p>

  <p>The Code did not merely embody contemporary custom or conserve ancient
  law. It is true that centuries of law-abiding and litigious habitude had
  accumulated in the temple archives of each city vast stores of precedent
  in ancient deeds and the records of judicial decisions, and that
  intercourse had assimilated city custom. The universal habit of writing
  and perpetual recourse to written contract even more modified primitive
  custom and ancient precedent. Provided the parties could agree, the Code
  left them free to contract as a rule. Their deed of agreement was drawn
  up in the temple by a notary public, and confirmed by an oath "by god and
  the king." It was publicly sealed and witnessed by professional
  witnesses, as well as by collaterally interested parties. The manner in
  which it was thus executed may have been sufficient security that its
  stipulations were not impious or illegal. Custom or public opinion
  doubtless secured that the parties would not agree to wrong. In case of
  dispute the judges dealt first with the contract. They might not sustain
  it, but if the parties did not dispute it, they were free to observe it.
  The judges' decision might, however, be appealed against. Many contracts
  contain the proviso that in case of future dispute the parties would
  abide by "the decision of the king." The Code made known, in a vast
  number of cases, what that decision would be, and many cases of appeal to
  the king were sent back to the judges with orders to decide in accordance
  with it. The Code itself was carefully and logically arranged and the
  order of its sections was conditioned by their subject-matter.
  Nevertheless the order is not that of modern scientific treatises, and a
  somewhat different order from both is most convenient for our
  purpose.</p>

  <p>The Code contemplates the whole population as falling into three
  classes, the <i>amelu</i>, the <i>muskinu</i> and the <i>ardu</i>. The
  <i>amelu</i> was a patrician, the man of family, whose birth, marriage
  and death were registered, of ancestral estates and full civil rights. He
  had aristocratic privileges and responsibilities, the right to exact
  retaliation for corporal injuries, and liability to heavier punishment
  for crimes and misdemeanours, higher fees and fines to pay. To this class
  belonged the king and court, the higher officials, the professions and
  craftsmen. The term became in time a mere courtesy title but originally
  carried with it standing. Already in the Code, when status is not
  concerned, it is used to denote "any one." There was no property
  qualification nor does the term appear to be racial. It is most difficult
  to characterize the <i>muskinu</i> exactly. The term came in time to mean
  "a beggar" and with that meaning has passed through Aramaic and Hebrew
  into many modern languages; but though the Code does not regard him as
  necessarily poor, he may have been landless. He was free, but had to
  accept monetary compensation for corporal injuries, paid smaller fees and
  fines, even paid less offerings to the gods. He inhabited a separate
  quarter of the city. There is no reason to regard him as specially
  connected with the court, as a royal pensioner, nor as forming the bulk
  of the population. The rarity of any reference to him in contemporary
  documents makes further specification conjectural. The <i>ardu</i> was a
  slave, his master's chattel, and formed a very numerous class. He could
  acquire property and even hold other slaves. His master clothed and fed
  him, paid his doctor's fees, but took all compensation paid for injury
  done to him. His master usually found him a slave-girl as wife (the
  children were then born slaves), often set him up in a house (with farm
  or business) and simply took an annual rent of him. Otherwise he might
  marry a freewoman (the children were then free), who might bring him a
  dower which his master could not touch, and at his death one-half of his
  property passed to his master as his heir. He could acquire his freedom
  by purchase from his master, or might be freed and dedicated to a temple,
  or even adopted, when he became an <i>amelu</i> and not a <i>muskinu</i>.
  Slaves were recruited by purchase abroad, from captives taken in war and
  by freemen degraded for debt or crime. A slave often ran away; if caught,
  the captor was bound to restore him to his master, and the Code fixes a
  reward of two shekels which the owner must pay the captor. It was about
  one-tenth of the average value. To detain, harbour, &amp;c., a slave was
  punished by death. So was an attempt to get him to leave the city. A
  slave bore an identification mark, which could only be removed by a
  surgical operation and which later consisted of his owner's name tattoed
  or branded on the arm. On the great estates in Assyria and its subject
  provinces were many serfs, mostly of subject race, settled captives, or
  quondam slaves, tied to the soil they cultivated and sold with the estate
  but capable of possessing land and property of their own. There is little
  trace of serfs in Babylonia, unless the <i>muskinu</i> be really a
  serf.</p>

  <p>The god of a city was originally owner of its land, which encircled it
  with an inner ring of irrigable arable land and an outer fringe of
  pasture, and the citizens were his tenants. The god and his viceregent,
  the king, had long ceased to disturb tenancy, and were content with fixed
  dues in <i>naturalia</i>, stock, <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[v.03 p.0117]</span>money or
  service. One of the earliest monuments records the purchase by a king of
  a large estate for his son, paying a fair market price and adding a
  handsome honorarium to the many owners in costly garments, plate, and
  precious articles of furniture. The Code recognizes complete private
  ownership in land, but apparently extends the right to hold land to
  votaries, merchants (and resident aliens?). But all land was sold subject
  to its fixed charges. The king, however, could free land from these
  charges by charter, which was a frequent way of rewarding those who
  deserved well of the state. It is from these charters that we learn
  nearly all we know of the obligations that lay upon land. The state
  demanded men for the army and the corvée as well as dues in kind. A
  definite area was bound to find a bowman together with his linked pikeman
  (who bore the shield for both) and to furnish them with supplies for the
  campaign. This area was termed "a bow" as early as the 8th century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, but the usage was much earlier. Later, a
  horseman was due from certain areas. A man was only bound to serve so
  many (six?) times, but the land had to find a man annually. The service
  was usually discharged by slaves and serfs, but the <i>amelu</i> (and
  perhaps the <i>muskinu</i>) went to war. The "bows" were grouped in tens
  and hundreds. The corvée was less regular. The letters of Khammurabi
  often deal with claims to exemption. Religious officials and shepherds in
  charge of flocks were exempt. Special liabilities lay upon riparian
  owners to repair canals, bridges, quays, &amp;c. The state claimed
  certain proportions of all crops, stock, &amp;c. The king's messengers
  could commandeer any subject's property, giving a receipt. Further, every
  city had its own octroi duties, customs, ferry dues, highway and water
  rates. The king had long ceased to be, if he ever was, owner of the land.
  He had his own royal estates, his private property and dues from all his
  subjects. The higher officials had endowments and official residences.
  The Code regulates the feudal position of certain classes. They held an
  estate from the king consisting of house, garden, field, stock and a
  salary, on condition of personal service on the king's errand. They could
  not delegate the service on pain of death. When ordered abroad they could
  nominate a son, if capable, to hold the benefice and carry on the duty.
  If there was no son capable, the state put in a <i>locum tenens</i>, but
  granted one-third to the wife to maintain herself and children. The
  benefice was inalienable, could not be sold, pledged, exchanged, sublet,
  devised or diminished. Other land was held of the state for rent.
  Ancestral estate was strictly tied to the family. If a holder would sell,
  the family had the right of redemption and there seems to have been no
  time-limit to its exercise.</p>

  <p>The temple occupied a most important position. It received from its
  estates, from tithes and other fixed dues, as well as from the sacrifices
  (a customary share) and other offerings of the faithful, vast amounts of
  all sorts of <i>naturalia</i>; besides money and permanent gifts. The
  larger temples had many officials and servants. Originally, perhaps, each
  town clustered round one temple, and each head of a family had a right to
  minister there and share its receipts. As the city grew, the right to so
  many days a year at one or other shrine (or its "gate") descended in
  certain families and became a species of property which could be pledged,
  rented or shared within the family, but not alienated. In spite of all
  these demands, however, the temples became great granaries and
  store-houses; as they also were the city archives. The temple had its
  responsibilities. If a citizen was captured by the enemy and could not
  ransom himself the temple of his city must do so. To the temple came the
  poor farmer to borrow seed corn or supplies for harvesters,
  &amp;c.&mdash;advances which he repaid without interest. The king's power
  over the temple was not proprietary but administrative. He might borrow
  from it but repaid like other borrowers. The tithe seems to have been the
  composition for the rent due to the god for his land. It is not clear
  that all lands paid tithe, perhaps only such as once had a special
  connexion with the temple.</p>

  <p>The Code deals with a class of persons devoted to the service of a
  god, as vestals or hierodules. The vestals were vowed to chastity, lived
  together in a great nunnery, were forbidden to open or enter a tavern,
  and together with other votaries had many privileges.</p>

  <p>The Code recognizes many ways of disposing of property&mdash;sale,
  lease, barter, gift, dedication, deposit, loan, pledge, all of which were
  matters of contract. Sale was the delivery of the purchase (in the case
  of real estate symbolized by a staff, a key, or deed of conveyance) in
  return for the purchase money, receipts being given for both. Credit, if
  given, was treated as a debt, and secured as a loan by the seller to be
  repaid by the buyer, for which he gave a bond. The Code admits no claim
  unsubstantiated by documents or the oath of witnesses. A buyer had to
  convince himself of the seller's title. If he bought (or received on
  deposit) from a minor or a slave without power of attorney, he would be
  executed as a thief. If the goods were stolen and the rightful owner
  reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and
  the deed of sale or witnesses to it. Otherwise he would be adjudged a
  thief and die. If he proved his purchase, he had to give up the property
  but had his remedy against the seller or, if he had died, could reclaim
  five-fold from his estate. A man who bought a slave abroad, might find
  that he had been stolen or captured from Babylonia, and he had to restore
  him to his former owner without profit. If he bought property belonging
  to a feudal holding, or to a ward in chancery, he had to return it and
  forfeit what he gave for it as well. He could repudiate the purchase of a
  slave attacked by the <i>bennu</i> sickness within the month (later, a
  hundred days), and had a female slave three days on approval. A defect of
  title or undisclosed liability would invalidate the sale at any time.</p>

  <p>Landowners frequently cultivated their land themselves but might
  employ a husbandman or let it. The husbandman was bound to carry out the
  proper cultivation, raise an average crop and leave the field in good
  tilth. In case the crop failed the Code fixed a statutory return. Land
  might be let at a fixed rent when the Code enacted that accidental loss
  fell on the tenant. If let on share-profit, the landlord and tenant
  shared the loss proportionately to their stipulated share of profit. If
  the tenant paid his rent and left the land in good tilth, the landlord
  could not interfere nor forbid subletting. Waste land was let to reclaim,
  the tenant being rent free for three years and paying a stipulated rent
  in the fourth year. If the tenant neglected to reclaim the land the Code
  enacted that he must hand it over in good faith and fixed a statutory
  rent. Gardens or plantations were let in the same ways and under the same
  conditions; but for date-groves four years' free tenure was allowed. The
  metayer system was in vogue, especially on temple lands. The landlord
  found land, labour, oxen for ploughing and working the watering-machines,
  carting, threshing or other implements, seed corn, rations for the
  workmen and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or steward, usually had
  other land of his own. If he stole the seed, rations or fodder, the Code
  enacted that his fingers should be cut off. If he appropriated or sold
  the implements, impoverished or sublet the cattle, he was heavily fined
  and in default of payment might be condemned to be torn to pieces by the
  cattle on the field. Rent was as contracted.</p>

  <p>Irrigation was indispensable. If the irrigator neglected to repair his
  dyke, or left his runnel open and caused a flood, he had to make good the
  damage done to his neighbours' crops, or be sold with his family to pay
  the cost. The theft of a watering-machine, water-bucket or other
  agricultural implement was heavily fined.</p>

  <p>Houses were let usually for the year, but also for longer terms, rent
  being paid in advance, half-yearly. The contract generally specified that
  the house was in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep it so. The
  woodwork, including doors and door frames, was removable, and the tenant
  might bring and take away his own. The Code enacted that if the landlord
  would re-enter before the term was up, he must remit a fair proportion of
  the rent. Land was leased for houses or other buildings to be built upon
  it, the tenant being rent-free for eight or ten years; after which the
  building came into the landlord's possession.</p>

  <p>Despite the multitude of slaves, hired labour was often needed,
  especially at harvest. This was matter of contract, and the hirer, <!--
  Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[v.03
  p.0118]</span>who usually paid in advance, might demand a guarantee to
  fulfil the engagement. Cattle were hired for ploughing, working the
  watering-machines, carting, threshing, etc. The Code fixed a statutory
  wage for sowers, ox-drivers, field-labourers, and hire for oxen, asses,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>There were many herds and flocks. The flocks were committed to a
  shepherd who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code
  fixed him a wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for
  ox, sheep for sheep, must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of
  the flock had to be repaid ten-fold, but loss by disease or wild beasts
  fell on the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his neglect. If
  he let the flock feed on a field of corn he had to pay damages four-fold;
  if he turned them into standing corn when they ought to have been folded
  he paid twelve-fold.</p>

  <p>In commercial matters, payment in kind was still common, though the
  contracts usually stipulate for cash, naming the standard expected, that
  of Babylon, Larsa, Assyria, Carchemish, &amp;c. The Code enacted,
  however, that a debtor must be allowed to pay in produce according to
  statutory scale. If a debtor had neither money nor crop, the creditor
  must not refuse goods.</p>

  <p>Debt was secured on the person of the debtor. Distraint on a debtor's
  corn was forbidden by the Code; not only must the creditor give it back,
  but his illegal action forfeited his claim altogether. An unwarranted
  seizure for debt was fined, as was the distraint of a working ox. The
  debtor being seized for debt could nominate as mancipium or hostage to
  work off the debt, his wife, a child, or slave. The creditor could only
  hold a wife or child three years as mancipium. If the mancipium died a
  natural death while in the creditor's possession no claim could lie
  against the latter; but if he was the cause of death by cruelty, he had
  to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage,
  unless she were a slave-girl who had borne her master children. She had
  to be redeemed by her owner.</p>

  <p>The debtor could also pledge his property, and in contracts often
  pledged a field, house or crop. The Code enacted, however, that the
  debtor should always take the crop himself and pay the creditor from it.
  If the crop failed, payment was deferred and no interest could be charged
  for that year. If the debtor did not cultivate the field himself he had
  to pay for the cultivation, but if the cultivation was already finished
  he must harvest it himself and pay his debt from the crop. If the
  cultivator did not get a crop this would not cancel his contract. Pledges
  were often made where the intrinsic value of the article was equivalent
  to the amount of the debt; but antichretic pledge was more common, where
  the profit of the pledge was a set-off against the interest of the debt.
  The whole property of the debtor might be pledged as security for the
  payment of the debt, without any of it coming into the enjoyment of the
  creditor. Personal guarantees were often given that the debtor would
  repay or the guarantor become liable himself.</p>

  <p>Trade was very extensive. A common way of doing business was for a
  merchant to entrust goods or money to a travelling agent, who sought a
  market for his goods. The caravans travelled far beyond the limits of the
  empire. The Code insisted that the agent should inventory and give a
  receipt for all that he received. No claim could be made for anything not
  so entered. Even if the agent made no profit he was bound to return
  double what he had received, if he made poor profit he had to make up the
  deficiency; but he was not responsible for loss by robbery or extortion
  on his travels. On his return, the principal must give a receipt for what
  was handed over to him. Any false entry or claim on the agent's part was
  penalised three-fold, on the principal's part six-fold. In normal cases
  profits were divided according to contract, usually equally.</p>

  <p>A considerable amount of forwarding was done by the caravans. The
  carrier gave a receipt for the consignment, took all responsibility and
  exacted a receipt on delivery. If he defaulted he paid five-fold. He was
  usually paid in advance. Deposit, especially warehousing of grain, was
  charged for at one-sixtieth. The warehouseman took all risks, paid double
  for all shortage, but no claim could be made unless he had given a
  properly witnessed receipt. Water traffic on the Euphrates and canals was
  early very considerable. Ships, whose tonnage was estimated at the amount
  of grain they could carry, were continually hired for the transport of
  all kinds of goods. The Code fixes the price for building and insists on
  the builder's giving a year's guarantee of seaworthiness. It fixes the
  hire of ship and of crew. The captain was responsible for the freight and
  the ship; he had to replace all loss. Even if he refloated the ship he
  had to pay a fine of half its value for sinking it. In the case of
  collision the boat under way was responsible for damages to the boat at
  anchor. The Code also regulated the liquor traffic, fixing a fair price
  for beer and forbidding the connivance of the tavern-keeper (a female!)
  at disorderly conduct or treasonable assembly, under pain of death. She
  was to hale the offenders to the palace, which implied an efficient and
  accessible police system.</p>

  <p>Payment through a banker or by written draft against deposit was
  frequent. Bonds to pay were treated as negotiable. Interest was rarely
  charged on advances by the temple or wealthy landowners for pressing
  needs, but this may have been part of the metayer system. The borrowers
  may have been tenants. Interest was charged at very high rates for
  overdue loans of this kind. Merchants (and even temples in some cases)
  made ordinary business loans, charging from 20 to 30%.</p>

  <p>Marriage retained the form of purchase, but was essentially a contract
  to be man and wife together. The marriage of young people was usually
  arranged between the relatives, the bridegroom's father providing the
  bride-price, which with other presents the suitor ceremonially presented
  to the bride's father. This bride-price was usually handed over by her
  father to the bride on her marriage, and so came back into the
  bridegroom's possession, along with her dowry, which was her portion as a
  daughter. The bride-price varied much, according to the position of the
  parties, but was in excess of that paid for a slave. The Code enacted
  that if the father does not, after accepting a man's presents, give him
  his daughter, he must return the presents doubled. Even if his decision
  was brought about by libel on the part of the suitor's friend this was
  done, and the Code enacted that the faithless friend should not marry the
  girl. If a suitor changed his mind, he forfeited the presents. The dowry
  might include real estate, but generally consisted of personal effects
  and household furniture. It remained the wife's for life, descending to
  her children, if any; otherwise returning to her family, when the husband
  could deduct the bride-price if it had not been given to her, or return
  it, if it had. The marriage ceremony included joining of hands and the
  utterance of some formula of acceptance on the part of the bridegroom, as
  "I am the son of nobles, silver and gold shall fill thy lap, thou shall
  be my wife, I will be thy husband. Like the fruit of a garden I will give
  thee offspring." It must be performed by a freeman.</p>

  <p>The marriage contract, without which the Code ruled that the woman was
  no wife, usually stated the consequences to which each party was liable
  for repudiating the other. These by no means necessarily agree with the
  Code. Many conditions might be inserted: as that the wife should act as
  maidservant to her mother-in-law, or to a first wife. The married couple
  formed a unit as to external responsibility, especially for debt. The man
  was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her
  marriage, as well as for his own; but he could use her as a mancipium.
  Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract,
  that the wife should not be seized for her husband's pre-nuptial debts;
  but enacted that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts,
  and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts
  contracted after marriage. A man might make his wife a settlement by deed
  of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of his property, and he
  might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favourite child, but
  she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married she always
  remained a member of her father's house&mdash;she is rarely named wife of
  A, usually daughter of B, or mother of C.</p>

  <p>Divorce was optional with the man, but he had to restore the dowry
  and, if the wife had borne him children, she had the <!-- Page 119
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[v.03
  p.0119]</span>custody of them. He had then to assign her the income of
  field, or garden, as well as goods, to maintain herself and children
  until they grew up. She then shared equally with them in the allowance
  (and apparently in his estate at his death) and was free to marry again.
  If she had no children, he returned her the dowry and paid her a sum
  equivalent to the bride-price, or a mina of silver, if there had been
  none. The latter is the forfeit usually named in the contract for his
  repudiation of her.</p>

  <p>If she had been a bad wife, the Code allowed him to send her away,
  while he kept the children and her dowry; or he could degrade her to the
  position of a slave in his own house, where she would have food and
  clothing. She might bring an action against him for cruelty and neglect
  and, if she proved her case, obtain a judicial separation, taking with
  her her dowry. No other punishment fell on the man. If she did not prove
  her case, but was proved to be a bad wife, she was drowned. If she were
  left without maintenance during her husband's involuntary absence, she
  could cohabit with another man, but must return to her husband if he came
  back, the children of the second union remaining with their own father.
  If she had maintenance, a breach of the marriage tie was adultery. Wilful
  desertion by, or exile of, the husband dissolved the marriage, and if he
  came back he had no claim on her property; possibly not on his own.</p>

  <p>As a widow, the wife took her husband's place in the family, living on
  in his house and bringing up the children. She could only remarry with
  judicial consent, when the judge was bound to inventory the deceased's
  estate and hand it over to her and her new husband in trust for the
  children. They could not alienate a single utensil. If she did not
  remarry, she lived on in her husband's house and took a child's share on
  the division of his estate, when the children had grown up. She still
  retained her dowry and any settlement deeded to her by her husband. This
  property came to her children. If she had remarried, all her children
  shared equally in her dowry, but the first husband's gift fell to his
  children or to her selection among them, if so empowered.</p>

  <p>Monogamy was the rule, and a childless wife might give her husband a
  maid (who was no wife) to bear him children, who were reckoned hers. She
  remained mistress of her maid and might degrade her to slavery again for
  insolence, but could not sell her if she had borne her husband children.
  If the wife did this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a
  concubine. If she would not, he could do so. The concubine was a wife,
  though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A
  concubine was a free woman, was often dowered for marriage and her
  children were legitimate. She could only be divorced on the same
  conditions as a wife. If a wife became a chronic invalid, the husband was
  bound to maintain her in the home they had made together, unless she
  preferred to take her dowry and go back to her father's house; but he was
  free to remarry. In all these cases the children were legitimate and
  legal heirs.</p>

  <p>There was, of course, no hindrance to a man having children by a slave
  girl. These children were free, in any case, and their mother could not
  be sold, though she might be pledged, and she was free on her master's
  death. These children could be legitimized by their father's
  acknowledgment before witnesses, and were often adopted. They then ranked
  equally in sharing their father's estate, but if not adopted, the wife's
  children divided and took first choice.</p>

  <p>Vestal virgins were not supposed to have children, yet they could and
  often did marry. The Code contemplated that such a wife would give a
  husband a maid as above. Free women might marry slaves and be dowered for
  the marriage. The children were free, and at the slave's death the wife
  took her dowry and half what she and her husband had acquired in wedlock
  for self and children; the master taking the other half as his slave's
  heir.</p>

  <p>A father had control over his children till their marriage. He had a
  right to their labour in return for their keep. He might hire them out
  and receive their wages, pledge them for debt, even sell them outright.
  Mothers had the same rights in the absence of the father; even elder
  brothers when both parents were dead. A father had no claim on his
  married children for support, but they retained a right to inherit on his
  death.</p>

  <p>The daughter was not only in her father's power to be given in
  marriage, but he might dedicate her to the service of some god as a
  vestal or a hierodule; or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in
  these matters, which were often decided in her childhood. A grown-up
  daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an
  uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her
  wish. In all these cases the father might dower her. If he did not, on
  his death the brothers were bound to do so, giving her a full child's
  share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's
  share if she were a hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the
  privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her
  property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry,
  which reverted to their family, if childless, or went to their children
  if they had any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a
  daughter power to leave her property to a favourite brother or sister. A
  daughter's estate was usually managed for her by her brothers, but if
  they did not satisfy her, she could appoint a steward. If she married,
  her husband managed it.</p>

  <p>The son also appears to have received his share on marriage, but did
  not always then leave his father's house; he might bring his wife there.
  This was usual in child marriages.</p>

  <p>Adoption was very common, especially where the father (or mother) was
  childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child
  was then adopted to care for the parents' old age. This was done by
  contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what
  maintenance was expected. The real children, if any, were usually
  consenting parties to an arrangement which cut off their expectations.
  They even, in some cases, found the estate for the adopted child who was
  to relieve them of a care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the
  filial duty the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were
  often adopted and if they proved unfilial were reduced to slavery
  again.</p>

  <p>A craftsman often adopted a son to learn the craft. He profited by the
  son's labour. If he failed to teach his son the craft, that son could
  prosecute him and get the contract annulled. This was a form of
  apprenticeship, and it is not clear that the apprentice had any filial
  relation.</p>

  <p>A man who adopted a son, and afterwards married and had a family of
  his own, could dissolve the contract but must give the adopted child
  one-third of a child's share in goods, but no real estate. That could
  only descend in the family to which he had ceased to belong. Vestals
  frequently adopted daughters, usually other vestals, to care for their
  old age.</p>

  <p>Adoption had to be with consent of the real parents, who usually
  executed a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim
  upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves
  had no rights over their children and could raise no obstacle. Foundlings
  and illegitimate children had no parents to object. If the adopted child
  discovered his true parents and wanted to return to them, his eye or
  tongue was torn out. An adopted child was a full heir, the contract might
  even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually he was residuary
  legatee.</p>

  <p>All legitimate children shared equally in the father's estate at his
  death, reservation being made of a bride-price for an unmarried son,
  dower for a daughter or property deeded to favourite children by the
  father. There was no birthright attaching to the position of eldest son,
  but he usually acted as executor and after considering what each had
  already received equalized the shares. He even made grants in excess to
  the others from his own share. When there were two mothers, the two
  families shared equally in the father's estate until later times when the
  first family took two-thirds. Daughters, in the absence of sons, had
  sons' rights. Children also shared their own mother's property, but had
  no share in that of a stepmother.</p>

  <p>A father could disinherit a son in early times without restriction,
  but the Code insisted upon judicial consent and that only for repeated
  unfilial conduct. In early times the son who denied his father had his
  front hair shorn, a slave-mark put on him, and <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[v.03 p.0120]</span>could be sold
  as a slave; while if he denied his mother he had his front hair shorn,
  was driven round the city as an example and expelled his home, but not
  degraded to slavery.</p>

  <p>Adultery was punished with the death of both parties by drowning, but
  if the husband was willing to pardon his wife, the king might intervene
  to pardon the paramour. For incest with his own mother, both were burned
  to death; with a stepmother, the man was disinherited; with a daughter,
  the man was exiled; with a daughter-in-law, he was drowned; with a son's
  betrothed, he was fined. A wife who for her lover's sake procured her
  husband's death was gibbeted. A betrothed girl, seduced by her
  prospective father-in-law, took her dowry and returned to her family, and
  was free to marry as she chose.</p>

  <p>In the criminal law the ruling principle was the <i>lex talionis</i>.
  Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb was the penalty for assault
  upon an <i>amelu</i>. A sort of symbolic retaliation was the punishment
  of the offending member, seen in the cutting off the hand that struck a
  father or stole a trust; in cutting off the breast of a wet-nurse who
  substituted a changeling for the child entrusted to her; in the loss of
  the tongue that denied father or mother (in the Elamite contracts the
  same penalty was inflicted for perjury); in the loss of the eye that
  pried into forbidden secrets. The loss of the surgeon's hand that caused
  loss of life or limb; or the brander's hand that obliterated a slave's
  identification mark, are very similar. The slave, who struck a freeman or
  denied his master, lost an ear, the organ of hearing and symbol of
  obedience. To bring another into danger of death by false accusation was
  punished by death. To cause loss of liberty or property by false witness
  was punished by the penalty the perjurer sought to bring upon
  another.</p>

  <p>The death penalty was freely awarded for theft and other crimes
  regarded as coming under that head; for theft involving entrance of
  palace or temple treasury, for illegal purchase from minor or slave, for
  selling stolen goods or receiving the same, for common theft in the open
  (in default of multiple restoration) or receiving the same, for false
  claim to goods, for kidnapping, for assisting or harbouring fugitive
  slaves, for detaining or appropriating same, for brigandage, for
  fraudulent sale of drink, for disorderly conduct of tavern, for
  delegation of personal service, for misappropriating the levy, for
  oppression of feudal holders, for causing death of a householder by bad
  building. The manner of death is not specified in these cases. This death
  penalty was also fixed for such conduct as placed another in danger of
  death. A specified form of death penalty occurs in the following cases:
  gibbeting (on the spot where crime was committed) for burglary, later
  also for encroaching on the king's highway, for getting a slave-brand
  obliterated, for procuring husband's death; burning for incest with own
  mother, for vestal entering or opening tavern, for theft at fire (on the
  spot); drowning for adultery, rape of betrothed maiden, bigamy, bad
  conduct as wife, seduction of daughter-in-law.</p>

  <p>A curious extension of the <i>talio</i> is the death of creditor's son
  for his father's having caused the death of debtor's son as mancipium; of
  builder's son for his father's causing the death of house-owner's son by
  building the house badly; the death of a man's daughter because her
  father caused the death of another man's daughter.</p>

  <p>The contracts naturally do not concern such criminal cases as the
  above, as a rule, but marriage contracts do specify death by strangling,
  drowning, precipitation from a tower or pinnacle of the temple or by the
  iron sword for a wife's repudiation of her husband. We are quite without
  evidence as to the executive in all these cases.</p>

  <p>Exile was inflicted for incest with a daughter; disinheritance for
  incest with a stepmother or for repeated unfilial conduct. Sixty strokes
  of an ox-hide scourge were awarded for a brutal assault on a superior,
  both being <i>amelu</i>. Branding (perhaps the equivalent of degradation
  to slavery) was the penalty for slander of a married woman or vestal.
  Deprivation of office in perpetuity fell upon the corrupt judge.
  Enslavement befell the extravagant wife and unfilial children.
  Imprisonment was common, but is not recognized by the Code.</p>

  <p>The commonest of all penalties was a fine. This is awarded by the Code
  for corporal injuries to a <i>muskinu</i> or slave (paid to his master);
  for damages done to property, for breach of contract. The restoration of
  goods appropriated, illegally bought, or damaged by neglect, was usually
  accompanied by a fine, giving it the form of multiple restoration. This
  might be double, treble, fourfold, fivefold, sixfold, tenfold,
  twelvefold, even thirtyfold, according to the enormity of the
  offence.</p>

  <p>The Code recognized the importance of intention. A man who killed
  another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally, and was
  then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not
  say what would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded
  where death is caused that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put
  to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the
  assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced
  to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and
  was free. The owner of an ox which gored a man on the street was only
  responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious, even if
  it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the
  creditor's hand, the creditor was scot free. In ordinary cases
  responsibility was not demanded for accident or for more than proper
  care. Poverty excused bigamy on the part of a deserted wife.</p>

  <p>On the other hand carelessness and neglect were severely punished, as
  in the case of the unskilful physician, if it led to loss of life or limb
  his hands were cut off, a slave had to be replaced, the loss of his eye
  paid for to half his value; a veterinary surgeon who caused the death of
  an ox or ass paid quarter value; a builder, whose careless workmanship
  caused death, lost his life or paid for it by the death of his child,
  replaced slave or goods, and in any case had to rebuild the house or make
  good any damages due to defective building and repair the defect as well.
  The boat-builder had to make good any defect of construction or damage
  due to it for a year's warranty.</p>

  <p>Throughout the Code respect is paid to status.</p>

  <p>Suspicion was not enough. The criminal must be taken in the act,
  <i>e.g.</i> the adulterer, ravisher, &amp;c. A man could not be convicted
  of theft unless the goods were found in his possession.</p>

  <p>In the case of a lawsuit the plaintiff preferred his own plea. There
  is no trace of professional advocates, but the plea had to be in writing
  and the notary doubtless assisted in the drafting of it. The judge saw
  the plea, called the other parties before him and sent for the witnesses.
  If these were not at hand he might adjourn the case for their production,
  specifying a time up to six months. Guarantees might be entered into to
  produce the witnesses on a fixed day. The more important cases,
  especially those involving life and death, were tried by a bench of
  judges. With the judges were associated a body of elders, who shared in
  the decision, but whose exact function is not yet clear. Agreements,
  declarations and non-contentious cases are usually witnessed by one judge
  and twelve elders.</p>

  <p>Parties and witnesses were put on oath. The penalty for false witness
  was usually that which would have been awarded the convicted criminal. In
  matters beyond the knowledge of men, as the guilt or innocence of an
  alleged wizard or a suspected wife, the ordeal by water was used. The
  accused jumped into the sacred river, and the innocent swam while the
  guilty drowned. The accused could clear himself by oath where his own
  knowledge was alone available. The plaintiff could swear to his loss by
  brigands, as to goods claimed, the price paid for a slave purchased
  abroad or the sum due to him. But great stress was laid on the production
  of written evidence. It was a serious thing to lose a document. The
  judges might be satisfied of its existence and terms by the evidence of
  the witnesses to it, and then issue an order that whenever found it
  should be given up. Contracts annulled were ordered to be broken. The
  court might go a journey to view the property and even take with them the
  sacred symbols on which oath was made.</p>

  <p>The decision given was embodied in writing, sealed and witnessed by
  the judges, the elders, witnesses and a scribe. Women might act in all
  these capacities. The parties swore an <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[v.03 p.0121]</span>oath, embodied
  in the document, to observe its stipulations. Each took a copy and one
  was held by the scribe to be stored in the archives.</p>

  <p>Appeal to the king was allowed and is well attested. The judges at
  Babylon seem to have formed a superior court to those of provincial
  towns, but a defendant might elect to answer the charge before the local
  court and refuse to plead at Babylon.</p>

  <p>Finally, it may be noted that many immoral acts, such as the use of
  false weights, lying, &amp;c., which could not be brought into court, are
  severely denounced in the Omen Tablets as likely to bring the offender
  into "the hand of God" as opposed to "the hand of the king."</p>

  <p><b>BACAU,</b> the capital of the department of Bacau, Rumania;
  situated among the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, and on the
  river Bistritza, which enters the river Sereth 5 m. S. Pop. (1900)
  16,187, including 7850 Jews. Although of modern growth, Bacau is one of
  the chief commercial centres in Moldavia, possessing many large timber
  yards. It is on the main railway from Czernovitz, in Bukovina, to Galatz;
  and on two branch lines, one of which enters Transylvania through the
  Ghimesh Pass, while both give access to the salt mines, petroleum wells
  and forests of the Carpathians.</p>

  <p><b>BACCARAT,</b> a gambling card-game (origin of name unknown),
  supposed to have been introduced into France from Italy during the reign
  of Charles VIII. There are two accepted varieties of the
  game&mdash;<i>baccarat chemin de fer</i> (railway) and <i>baccarat
  banque</i> (or <i>à deux tableaux</i>). In <i>baccarat chemin de fer</i>
  six full packs of cards are used. These are shuffled by a croupier and
  then by any of the players who wish to do so. From three to eleven
  persons may play. Counters are generally used and are sold by the banker
  who afterwards redeems them. The croupier takes a number of cards from
  the top of the pack and passes them to the player on his right (sometimes
  left) who becomes banker, a position which he holds until he loses, when
  the deal passes to the player next in order. The other players are called
  <i>punters</i>. The banker places before him the sum he wishes to stake
  and the punters do likewise, unless a punter desires to <i>go bank</i>,
  signifying his intention by saying, <i>Banco!</i> In this case he plays
  against the entire stake of the banker. After the stakes have been made
  the dealer deals a card to his right for the punters, then one to
  himself, then a third to his left for the punters and, finally, another
  to himself, all face downwards. Court cards and tens count nothing; all
  others the number of their pips. Each punter looks at his cards, and any
  one having 8 or 9 turns his card up and announces it, the hand then being
  at an end. The player having the highest stake plays for both punters,
  and if the card turned is better than that of the banker, the latter pays
  each punter the amount of his stake. If not, the banker wins all stakes
  and the game proceeds as before. If no announcement is made, meaning that
  neither player holds 8 or 9, the banker deals another card to the player
  on his right, who, if his first card is 6 or 7, will refuse it, fearing
  to overrun. The second card is turned face upwards on the table. If his
  card is 5 he may, or may not, accept the second card, according to his
  judgment. In case of his refusal the card is offered to the second
  punter. If the first card is <i>baccarat</i> (<i>i.e.</i> amounts to 0)
  or 1, 2, 3 or 4, a punter always accepts the second card. The banker then
  decides whether he will draw another card himself or expose his original
  ones, and when he has made his play pays or receives according as he wins
  or loses. Ties neither win nor lose but go over to the next deal. A
  player who has lost on <i>going bank</i> may go bank again, but no player
  may go bank more than twice in succession. In the variation <i>baccarat
  banque</i> (or <i>à deux tableaux</i>), three packs of cards are used and
  the banker is permanent; the player who offers to risk the largest amount
  occupying the position. A line is drawn across the table and any one
  wishing to do so may place his stake <i>à cheval</i>, <i>i.e.</i> on the
  line. Stakes so placed neither win nor lose if one side wins and the
  other loses, but win if both sides win and are lost if both sides lose.
  The laws of baccarat are complicated and no one code is accepted as
  authoritative, the different clubs making their own rules.</p>

  <p><b>BACCHANALIA,</b> the Lat. name for the wild and mystic festivals of
  Bacchus (Dionysus). They were introduced into Rome from lower Italy by
  way of Etruria, and held in secret, attended by women only, on three days
  in the year in the grove of Simila (<i>Stimula</i>, <i>Semele</i>; Ovid,
  <i>Fasti</i>, vi. 503), near the Aventine hill. Subsequently, admission
  to the rites were extended to men and celebrations took place five times
  a month. The evil reputation of these festivals, at which the grossest
  debaucheries took place, and all kinds of crimes and political
  conspiracies were supposed to be planned, led in 186 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> to a decree of the senate&mdash;the so-called
  <i>Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus</i>, inscribed on a bronze tablet
  discovered in Calabria (1640), now at Vienna&mdash;by which the
  Bacchanalia were prohibited throughout the whole of Italy, except in
  certain special cases, in which the senate reserved the right of allowing
  them, subject to certain restrictions. But, in spite of the severe
  punishment inflicted upon those who were found to be implicated in the
  criminal practices disclosed by state investigation, the Bacchanalia were
  not stamped out, at any rate in the south of Italy, for a very long time
  (Livy xxxix. 8-19, 41; xl. 19).</p>

  <p><b>BACCHYLIDES,</b> Greek lyric poet, was born at Iulis, in the island
  of Ceos. His father's name was probably Meidon; his mother was a sister
  of Simonides, himself a native of Iulis. Eusebius says that Bacchylides
  "flourished" (<span title="êkmazen" class="grk"
  >&#x1F24;&kappa;&mu;&alpha;&zeta;&epsilon;&nu;</span>) in Ol. 78. 2 (467
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>). As the term <span title="êkmazen" class="grk"
  >&#x1F24;&kappa;&mu;&alpha;&zeta;&epsilon;&nu;</span> refers to the
  physical prime, and was commonly placed at about the fortieth year, we
  may suppose that Bacchylides was born <i>circa</i> 507 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Among his Odes the earliest that can be
  approximately dated is xii.,<a name="FnAnchor_111"
  href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which may belong to 481 or 479
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>; the latest is vi., of which the date is
  fixed by the recently found fragment of the Olympic register to Ol. 82. 1
  (452 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>). He would thus have been some
  forty-nine years younger than his uncle Simonides, and some fifteen years
  younger than Pindar. Elsewhere Eusebius states that Bacchylides "was of
  repute" (<span title="egnôrizeto" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&gamma;&nu;&omega;&rho;&#x1F77;&zeta;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;</span>)
  in Ol. 87. 2 (431 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>); and Georgius
  Syncellus, using the same word, gives Ol. 88 (428-425 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). The phrase would mean that he was then in the
  fulness of years and of fame. There is nothing improbable in the
  supposition that he survived the beginning of the Peloponnesian war.</p>

  <p>Bacchylides, like Simonides and Pindar, visited the court of Hiero I.
  of Syracuse (478-467). In his fifth Ode (476 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), the word <span title="xenos" class="grk"
  >&xi;&#x1F73;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (v. 11) has been taken to mean
  that he had already been the guest of the prince; and, as Simonides went
  to Sicily in or about 477 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, that is not
  unlikely. Ode iii. (468 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) was possibly
  written at Syracuse, as verses 15 and 16 suggest. He there pays a high
  compliment to Hiero's taste in poetry (ver. 3 ff.). A scholium on
  <i>Pyth.</i> ii. 90 (166) avers that Hiero preferred the Odes of
  Bacchylides to those of Pindar. The Alexandrian scholars interpreted a
  number of passages in Pindar as hostile allusions to Bacchylides or
  Simonides. If the scholiasts <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>[v.03 p.0122]</span>are right, it would appear that
  Pindar regarded the younger of the two Cean poets as a jealous rival, who
  disparaged him to their common patron (schol. <i>Pyth.</i> ii. 52 f.),
  and as one whose poetical skill was due to study rather than to genius
  (<i>Ol.</i> ii. 91-110). In <i>Olymp.</i> ii. 96 the dual <span
  title="garueton" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F7B;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span>, if it
  does not refer to the uncle and nephew, remains mysterious; nor does it
  admit of probable emendation.<a name="FnAnchor_112"
  href="#Footnote_112"><sup>[2]</sup></a> One would gladly reject this
  tradition, to which the scholia so frequently refer; yet it would be rash
  to assume that it rested merely on surmise. The Alexandrians may have
  possessed evidence on the subject which is now lost. It is tolerably
  certain that the three poets were visitors at Hiero's court at about the
  same time: Pindar and Bacchylides wrote odes of the same kind in his
  honour; and there was a tradition that he preferred the younger poet.
  There is thus no intrinsic improbability in the hypothesis that Pindar's
  haughty spirit had suffered, or imagined, some mortification. It is
  noteworthy that, whereas in 476 and 470 both he and Bacchylides
  celebrated Hiero's victories, in 468 (the most important occasion of all)
  Bacchylides alone was commissioned to do so; although in that year Pindar
  composed an ode (<i>Olymp.</i> vi.) for another Syracusan victor at the
  same festival. Nor is it difficult to conceive that a despot such as
  Hiero, whose constitutional position was ill-defined, and who was perhaps
  all the more exigent of deference on that account, may have found the
  genial Ionian a more agreeable courtier than Pindar, an aristocrat of the
  Boeoto-Aeolic type, not unmindful of "his fathers the Aegidae," and
  rather prone to link the praises of his patron with a lofty intimation of
  his own claims (see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Olymp.</i> i. <i>ad fin.</i>). But,
  whatever may have been the true bearing of Pindar's occasional
  innuendoes, it is at any rate pleasant to find that in the extant work of
  Bacchylides there is not the faintest semblance of hostile allusion to
  any rival. Nay, one might almost imagine a compliment to Pindar, when, in
  mentioning Hesiod, he calls him <span title="Boiôtos anêr" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&omicron;&iota;&omega;&tau;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F75;&rho;</span>.</p>

  <p>Plutarch (<i>de Exilio</i>, p. 605 c) names Bacchylides in a list of
  writers, who after they had been banished from their native cities, were
  active and successful in literature. It was Peloponnesus that afforded a
  new home to the exiled poet. The passage gives no clue to date or
  circumstance; but it implies that Peloponnesus was the region where the
  poet's genius ripened and where he did the work which established his
  fame. This points to a residence of considerable length; and it may be
  noted that some of the poems illustrate their author's intimate knowledge
  of Peloponnesus. Thus in Ode viii., for Automedes of Phlius, he draws on
  the legends connected with the Phliasian river Asopus. In Ode x.,
  starting from the Argive legend of Proetus and Acrisius, he tells how the
  Arcadian cult of Artemis <span title="Hêmera" class="grk"
  >&#x1F29;&mu;&#x1F73;&rho;&alpha;</span> was founded. In one of his
  dithyrambs (xix.) he treated the legend of Idas (a Messenian hero) and
  Marpessa in the form of a <i>hymenaeus</i> sung by maidens of Sparta.</p>

  <p>The Alexandrian scholars, who drew up select lists of the best writers
  in each kind, included Bacchylides in their "canon" of the nine lyric
  poets, along with Alcman, Sappho, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Ibycus, Anacreon,
  Simonides and Pindar. The Alexandrian grammarian Didymus (<i>circ.</i> 30
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) wrote a commentary on the epinikian odes
  of Bacchylides. Horace, a poet in some respects of kindred genius, was a
  student of his works, and imitated him (according to Porphyrion) in
  <i>Odes</i>, i. 15, where Nereus predicts the destruction of Troy.
  Quotations from Bacchylides, or references to him, occur in Dionysius of
  Halicarnassus, Strabo, Plutarch, Stobaeus, Athenaeus, Aulus Gellius,
  Zenobius, Hephaestion, Clement of Alexandria, and various grammarians or
  scholiasts. Ammianus Marcellinus (xxv. 4) says that the emperor Julian
  enjoyed reading Bacchylides. It is clear, then, that this poet continued
  to be popular during at least the first four centuries of our era. No
  inference adverse to his repute can fairly be drawn from the fact that no
  mention of him occurs in the extant work of any Attic writer. The only
  definite estimate of him by an ancient critic occurs in the treatise
  <span title="Peri Hupsous" class="grk">&Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F76;
  &#x1F5D;&psi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span> commonly translated "On
  the Sublime," but meaning rather, "On the Sources of Elevation in Style";
  a work ambiguously ascribed to Cassius Longinus (<i>circ.</i> <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 260), but more probably due to some writer of
  the first century of our era. In chapter xxxiii. of that treatise, the
  author asks whether we ought to prefer "greatness" in literature, with
  some attendant faults, to flawless merit on a lower level, and of course
  replies in the affirmative. In tragedy, he asks, who would be Ion of
  Chios rather than Sophocles; or in lyric poetry, Bacchylides rather than
  Pindar? Yet Bacchylides and Ion are "faultless, with a style of perfect
  elegance and finish." In short, the essayist regards Bacchylides as a
  thoroughly finished poet of the second class, who never commits glaring
  faults, but never reaches the loftier heights.</p>

  <p>The first and most general quality of style in Bacchylides is his
  perfect simplicity and clearness. Where the text is not corrupt, there
  are few sentences which are not lucid in meaning and simple in structure.
  This lucidity is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he seldom
  attempts imagery of the bolder kind, and never has thoughts of a subtle
  or complex order. Yet it would be very unjust to regard such clearness as
  merely a compensatory merit of lyric mediocrity, or to ignore its
  intimate connexion with the man's native grace of mind, with the artist's
  feeling for expression, with the poet's delicate skill. How many readers,
  who could enjoy and appreciate Pindar if he were less difficult, are
  stopped on the threshold by the aspect of his style, and are fain to save
  their self-esteem by concluding that he is at once turgid and shallow! A
  pellucid style must always have been a source of wide, though modest,
  popularity for Bacchylides. If it be true that Hiero preferred him to
  Pindar, and that he was a favourite with Julian, those instances suggest
  the charm which he must always have had for cultivated readers to whom
  affairs did not leave much leisure for study, and who rejoiced in a poet
  with whom they could live on such easy terms.</p>

  <p>Another prominent trait in the style of Bacchylides is his love of
  picturesque detail. This characteristic marks the fragment by which,
  before the discovery of the 1896 MS., he was best known&mdash;a passage,
  from one of his paeans, on the blessings of peace (fr. 13, Bergk, 3,
  Jebb); and it frequently appears in the Odes, especially in the mythical
  narratives. Greater poets can make an image flash upon the mind, as
  Pindar sometimes does, by a magic phrase, or by throwing one or two
  salient points into strong relief. The method of Bacchylides is usually
  quieter; he paints cabinet pictures. Observation and elegance do more for
  him than grasp or piercing insight; but his work is often of very high
  excellence in its own kind. His treatment of simile is only a special
  phase of this general tendency. It is exemplified by the touches with
  which he elaborates the simile of the eagle in Ode v., and that of the
  storm-tossed mariners in Ode xii. This full development of simile is
  Homeric in manner, but not Homeric in motive: Homer's aim is vividness;
  Bacchylides is rather intent on the decorative value of the details
  themselves. There are occasional flashes of brilliancy in his imagery,
  when it is lit up by his keen sense of beauty or splendour in external
  nature. A radiance, "as of fire," streams from the forms of the Nereids
  (xvi. 103 ff.). An athlete shines out among his fellows like "the bright
  moon of the mid-month night" among the stars (viii. 27 ff.). The sudden
  gleam of hope which comes to the Trojans by the withdrawal of Achilles is
  like a ray of sunshine "from beneath the edge of a storm-cloud" (xii. 105
  ff.). The shades of the departed, as seen by Heracles on the banks of the
  Cocytus, are compared to the countless leaves fluttering in the wind on
  "the gleaming headlands of Ida" (v. 65 ff.)&mdash;an image not unworthy
  of Dante or of Milton.</p>

  <p>Among the minor features of this poet's style the most remarkable is
  his use of epithets. A god or goddess nearly always receives some
  ornamental epithet; sometimes, indeed, two or even three (<i>e.g.</i>
  <span title="kalukostephanou semnas ... Artemidos leukôlenou" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&phi;&#x1F71;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;
  &sigma;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf; ...
  &#x1F08;&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&mu;&#x1F77;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&kappa;&omega;&lambda;&#x1F73;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>,
  v. 98 f.). Such a trait is in unison with the epic manner, the
  straightforward narrative, which we find in some of the larger poems (as
  in v., x., and xvi.). On the other hand, the copious use of such ornament
  has the disadvantage that it sometimes gives a tinge of conventionality
  to his work. This impression is somewhat strengthened by the fact that
  many <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>[v.03
  p.0123]</span>of the epithets are long compound words, not found
  elsewhere and (in some cases at least) probably invented by the poet;
  words which suggest a deliberate effort to vary the stock repertory.</p>

  <p>The poems contained in the MS. of Bacchylides found (see below) in
  1896 are of two classes: I. <i>Odes of Victory</i>; II.
  <i>Dithyrambs</i>. The Ode of Victory, <span title="epinikion (melos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&pi;&iota;&nu;&#x1F77;&kappa;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
  (&mu;&#x1F73;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</span> or <span title="epinikos (humnos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F77;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  (&#x1F55;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</span>, is a form derived from the
  <span title="humnos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F55;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, which was properly a song in
  praise of a deity. Stesichorus (<i>c</i>. 610 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) seems to have been the first who composed hymns
  in honour, not of gods, but of heroes; the next step was to write hymns
  in celebration of victories by living men. This custom arose in the
  second half of the 6th century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, the age in
  which the games at the four great Greek festivals reached the fulness of
  their popularity. Simonides (b. <i>c</i>. 556 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) was the earliest recorded writer of
  <i>epinikia</i>. His odes of this class are now represented only by a few
  very small fragments, some twenty lines in all. Two of these fragments,
  belonging to the description of a chariot-race, warrant the belief that
  Simonides, in his epinikia, differed from Pindar in dwelling more on the
  incidents of the particular victory. The same characteristic is found in
  the epinikia of Bacchylides. His fifth ode, and Pindar's first
  <i>Olympian</i>, alike celebrate the victory of the horse Pherenicus;
  but, while Pindar's reference to the race itself is slight and general
  (vv. 20-22), Bacchylides describes the running of the winner much more
  vividly and fully (vv. 37-49).</p>

  <p>The MS. contains fourteen epinikia, or thirteen if Blass be right in
  supposing that Odes vi. and vii., as numbered by Kenyon in the <i>editio
  princeps</i>, are parts of a single ode (for Lachon of Ceos). Four (or on
  the view just stated, three) of the odes relate to the Olympian festival;
  two to the Pythian; three to the Isthmian; three to the Nemean; and one
  to a Thessalian festival called the <span title="Petraia" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&alpha;</span>. This comes last.
  The order in which the MS. arranges the other epinikia seems to be
  casual; at least it does not follow (1) the alphabetical sequence of the
  victors' names, or of the names of their cities; nor (2) chronological
  sequence; nor (3) classification by contests; nor (4) classification by
  festivals&mdash;except that the four great festivals precede the
  <i>Petraea</i>. The first ode, celebrating a victory of the Cean Argeios
  at the Isthmus, may possibly have been placed there for a biographical
  reason, viz., because the poet treated in it the early legends of his
  native island.</p>

  <p>A mythical narrative, connected in some way with the victor or his
  city, usually occupies the central part of the Pindaric ode. It serves to
  lift the poem into an ideal region, and to invest it with more than a
  local or temporary significance. The method of Bacchylides in this
  department of the epinikion is best illustrated by the myth of Croesus in
  Ode iii., that of Heracles and Meleager in Ode v., and that of the
  Proetides in Ode x. Pindar's habit is to select certain moments or scenes
  of a legend, which he depicts with great force and vividness.
  Bacchylides, on the other hand, has a gentle flow of simple epic
  narrative; he relies on the interest of the story as a whole, rather than
  on his power of presenting situations. Another element, always present in
  the longer odes of victory, is that which may be called the "gnomic."
  Here, again, there is a contrast between the two poets. Pindar packs his
  <span title="gnômai" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&nu;&#x1FF6;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>, his maxims or moral
  sentiments, into terse and sometimes obscure epigrams; he utters them in
  a didactic tone, as of one who can speak with the commanding voice of
  Delphic wisdom. The moralizing of Bacchylides is rather an utterance of
  quiet meditation, sometimes recalling the strain of Ionian gnomic
  elegy.</p>

  <p>The epinikia of Bacchylides are followed in the MS. by six
  compositions which the Alexandrians classed under the general name of
  <span title="dithuramboi" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&theta;&#x1F7B;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&iota;</span>,
  and which we, too, must be content to describe collectively as
  <i>Dithyrambs</i>. The derivation of <span title="di-thurambos" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;-&theta;&#x1F7B;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  is uncertain: <span title="di" class="grk">&delta;&iota;</span> may be
  the root seen in <span title="dios" class="grk"
  >&delta;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (cp. <span title="dipolia" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&pi;&#x1F79;&lambda;&iota;&alpha;</span>, and <span
  title="thurambos" class="grk"
  >&theta;&#x1F7B;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> another
  form of <span title="thriambos" class="grk"
  >&theta;&rho;&#x1F77;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, a word by
  which Cratinus (<i>c</i>. 448 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) denotes
  some kind of hymn to the wine-god. The "dithyramb," first mentioned by
  Archilochus (<i>c</i>. 670 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), received a
  finished and choral form from Arion of Lesbos (<i>c</i>. 600 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). His dithyrambs, produced at Corinth, belonged
  to the cult of Dionysus, and the members of his chorus (<span
  title="tragikos choros" class="grk"
  >&tau;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;
  &chi;&omicron;&rho;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>) personated satyrs. Originally
  concerned with the birth of the god, the dithyramb came to deal with all
  his fortunes: then its scope became still larger; it might celebrate, not
  Dionysus alone, but any god or hero. This last development had taken
  place before the close of the 6th century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  Simonides wrote a dithyramb on Memnon and Tithonus; Pindar, on Orion and
  on Heracles. Hence the Alexandrian scholars used <span
  title="dithurambos" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&theta;&#x1F7B;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  in a wide sense, as denoting simply a lyric poem occupied with a mythical
  narrative. Thus Ode xvii. of Bacchylides (relating the voyage of Theseus
  to Crete), though it was clearly a <span title="paian" class="grk"
  >&pi;&alpha;&iota;&#x1F71;&nu;</span> for the Delian Apollo, was classed
  by the Alexandrians among his "dithyrambs"&mdash;as appears not only from
  its place in our MS., but also from the allusion of Servius (on
  <i>Aen</i>. vi. 21). The six dithyrambs of Bacchylides are arranged in
  (approximately) alphabetical order: <span title="Antênoridai, Hêraklês, Ê'itheoi ê Thêseus, Thêseus, Iô, Idas" class="grk"
  >&#x1F08;&nu;&tau;&eta;&nu;&omicron;&rho;&#x1F77;&delta;&alpha;&iota;,
  &#x1F29;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&lambda;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf;,
  &#x1F28;&#x1FD3;&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&iota; &#x1F22;
  &Theta;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;,
  &Theta;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;, &#x1F38;&#x1F7D;,
  &#x1F3C;&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>. The principal feature, best
  exemplified by the first and third, is necessarily epic
  narrative,&mdash;often adorned with touches of picturesque detail, and
  animated by short speeches in the epic manner.</p>

  <p>Several other classes of composition are represented by those
  fragments of Bacchylides, preserved in ancient literature, which were
  known before the discovery of the new MS. (1) <span title="humnoi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F55;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&iota;</span>. Among these we hear of the <span
  title="apopemptikoi" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&pi;&omicron;&pi;&epsilon;&mu;&pi;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&#x1F77;</span>,
  hymns of pious farewell, speeding some god on his way at the season when
  he passed from one haunt to another. (2) <span title="paianes" class="grk"
  >&pi;&alpha;&iota;&#x1FB6;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, represented by
  the well-known fragment on the blessings of peace. (3) <span
  title="prosodia" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#x1F79;&delta;&iota;&alpha;</span>, choral
  odes sung during processions to temples. (4) <span title="huporchêmata" class="grk"
  >&#x1F51;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&chi;&#x1F75;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;</span>,
  lively dance-songs for religious festivals. (5) <span title="erôtika" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&rho;&omega;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F71;</span>, represented by
  five fragments of a class akin to <span title="skolia" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&kappa;&#x1F79;&lambda;&iota;&alpha;</span>, drinking-songs.
  Under this head come some lively and humorous verses on the power of
  wine, imitated by Horace (<i>Odes</i>, iii. 21. 13-20). It may be
  conjectured that the facile grace and bright fancy of Bacchylides were
  seen to especial advantage in light compositions of this kind. (6) The
  elegiacs of Bacchylides are represented by two <span title="epigrammata anathêmatika" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&pi;&iota;&gamma;&rho;&#x1F71;&mu;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
  &#x1F00;&nu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F71;</span>,
  each of four lines, in the Palatine Anthology. The first (<i>Anth</i>.
  vi. 313) is an inscription for an offering commemorative of a victory
  gained by a chorus with a poem written by Bacchylides. The second
  (<i>Anth</i>. vi. 53) is an inscription for a shrine dedicated to
  Zephyrus. Its authenticity has been questioned, but not disproved.</p>

  <p>The papyrus containing the odes of Bacchylides was found in Egypt by
  natives, and reached the British Museum in the autumn of 1896. It was
  then in about 200 pieces. By the skill and industry of Mr F.&nbsp;G. Kenyon,
  the editor of the <i>editio princeps</i> (1897), the MS. was
  reconstructed from these lacerated members. As now arranged, the MS.
  consists of three sections, (1) The first section contains 22 columns of
  writing. It breaks off after the 8 opening verses of Ode xii. (2) The
  second section contains columns 23-29. Of these, column 23 is represented
  only by the last letters of two words. This section comprises what
  remains of Odes xiii. and xiv. It breaks off before the end of xiv.,
  which is the last of the epinikia. (3) The third section comprises
  columns 30-39. It begins with the mutilated opening verses of Ode xv.
  (<span title="Antênoridai" class="grk"
  >&#x1F08;&nu;&tau;&eta;&nu;&omicron;&rho;&#x1F77;&delta;&alpha;&iota;</span>,
  the first of the dithyrambs), and breaks off after verse 11 of the last
  dithyramb,<span title="Idas" class="grk"
  >&#x1F3C;&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>. The number of lines in a column
  varies from 32 to 36, the usual number being 35, or (though less often)
  34.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to say how much has been lost between the end of
  column 29 and the beginning of column 30. Probably, however, Ode xiv., if
  not the last, was nearly the last of the epinikia. It concerns a festival
  of a merely local character, the Thessalian <span title="Petraia" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&alpha;</span>, and was therefore
  placed after the thirteen other epinikia, which are connected with the
  four great festivals. The same lacuna leaves it doubtful whether any
  collective title was prefixed to the <span title="dithuramboi" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&theta;&#x1F7B;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&iota;</span>.
  After the last column (39) of the MS., a good deal has probably been
  lost. Bacchylides seems to have written at least three other poems of
  this class (on Cassandra, Laocoon and Philoctetes); and these would have
  come, in alphabetical order, after the last of the extant six (Idas).</p>

  <p>The writing of the MS. is a fine uncial. It presents some traits of a
  distinctly Ptolemaic type, though it lacks some features found in the
  earlier Ptolemaic MSS. (those of the 3rd or 2nd century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). Among the characteristic forms of letters is
  the <a href="images/bacchylides_1.png"><img
  src="images/bacchylides_1.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex"
  alt="form of Upsilon" /></a>, with a shallow curve on the top of the
  upright; a form found in MSS. ascribed to the 1st century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and different from the more fully formed
  upsilon of the Roman period. Another very significant letter is the <span
  class="grk">&Xi;</span>, written as <a
  href="images/bacchylides_2.png"><img src="images/bacchylides_2.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="form of Xi" /></a>, a form which
  begins to go out after <i>c.</i> 50 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  giving place to one in which the middle stroke is connected with the
  other two. From these and other indications it is probable that the MS.
  is not later than the middle of the 1st century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p>The scribe, though he sometimes corrected his own mistakes, was, on
  the whole, careless of the sense, as of the metre; he seems to have been
  a mechanical copyist, excellent in penmanship, but <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[v.03 p.0124]</span>intent only on
  the letters. The MS. has received corrections or small supplements from
  at least two different persons. One of them (Kenyon's A²) was
  contemporary, or nearly so, with the scribe. The other (A³) was
  considerably later; he wrote a Roman cursive which might belong to the
  end of the 1st century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, or to the early
  part of the 2nd. The correctors seem to be generally trustworthy; though,
  like the scribe, they were inattentive to metre, passing over many
  metrical faults which could easily have been removed. They appear to have
  compared their MS. with another, or others; but they sometimes made a bad
  use of such aid, intruding a false reading where their text had the true
  one.</p>

  <p>Breathings are generally added, especially rough breathings; the form
  is usually square, but sometimes partially rounded. Accents are added,
  not to all words, but only, as a rule, to those which might cause doubt
  or difficulty to the reader. This was the Alexandrian practice, accents
  being regarded as aids to correct reading, and more liberally used when
  the dialect was not Attic. In accordance with the older system, the
  accent is not written on the last syllable of a word; when the accent
  falls there, a grave accent is written on the preceding syllable, or on
  two such syllables (<i>e.g.</i> <span title="blêchras, pauthalês" class="grk"
  >&beta;&lambda;&#x1F74;&chi;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;,
  &pi;&#x1F70;&upsilon;&theta;&#x1F70;&lambda;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>).</p>

  <p>As Kenyon observes, no MS. of equal antiquity is so well supplied with
  accents. The MS. which comes nearest to it in this respect is the Alcman
  fragment in the Louvre, which is of similar or slightly higher age,
  belonging perhaps to the early part of the 1st century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>; and in that MS. the comparatively frequent
  accents were doubtless designed to aid readers unfamiliar with Alcman's
  Laconian Doric. With regard to other grammatical or metrical signs (<span
  title="prosôidiai" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#x1FF3;&delta;&#x1F77;&alpha;&iota;</span>)
  used in the Bacchylides MS., there is not much that calls for special
  remark. The punctuation, whether by the scribe or by correctors, is very
  sparse, and certainly cannot always be regarded as authoritative. The
  signs denoting the end of a strophe or antistrophe (<i>paragraphus</i>),
  of an epode (<i>coronis</i>), or of an ode (<i>asterisk</i>), are often
  omitted by the scribe, and, when employed, are sometimes placed
  incorrectly, or employed in an irregular manner.</p>

  <p><b>BACCIO D'AGNOLO</b> (<i>c.</i> 1460-1543), Florentine wood-carver,
  sculptor and architect, had the family name of Baglioni, but was always
  known by the abbreviation of Bartolommeo into Baccio and the use of
  d'Agnolo as meaning the son of Angelo, his father's name. He started as a
  wood-carver, and between 1491 and 1502 did much of the decorative carving
  in the church of Santa Maria Novella and the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.
  Having made his reputation as a sculptor he appears to have turned his
  attention to architecture, and to have studied at Rome, though at what
  precise date is uncertain; but quite at the beginning of the 16th century
  he was engaged with Simon Pollajuolo in restoring the Palazzo Vecchio,
  and in 1506 he was commissioned to complete the drum of the cupola of the
  metropolitan church of Santa Maria del Fiore. The latter work, however,
  was interrupted on account of adverse criticisms from Michelangelo, and
  it remained unexecuted. Baccio d' Agnolo also planned the Villa Borghese
  and the Bartolini palace, with other fine palaces and villas. The
  Bartolini palace was the first house to be given frontispieces of columns
  to the door and windows, previously confined to churches; and he was
  ridiculed by the Florentines for his innovation. Another much-admired
  work by him was the campanile of the church of Santo Spirito. His studio
  was the resort of the most celebrated artists of the day, Michelangelo,
  Sansovino, the brothers Sangallo and the young Raphael. He died in 1543,
  leaving three sons, all architects, the best-known being Giuliano.</p>

  <p><b>BACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN</b> (1685-1750), German musical
  composer.</p>

  <p>The Bach family was of importance in the history of music for nearly
  two hundred years. Four branches of it were known at the beginning of the
  16th century, and in 1561 we hear of Hans Bach of Wechmar who is believed
  to be the father <span class="sidenote">Family.</span> of Veit Bach (born
  about 1555). The family genealogy, drawn up by J. Sebastian Bach himself
  and completed by his son Philipp Emanuel, describes Veit Bach as the
  founder of the family, a baker and a miller, "whose zither must have
  sounded very pretty among the clattering of the mill-wheels." His son,
  Hans Bach, "<i>der Spielmann</i>," is the first professional musician of
  the family. Of Hans's large family the second son, Christoph, was the
  grandfather of Sebastian Bach. Another son, Heinrich, of Arnstadt, had
  two sons, Johann Michael and Johann Christoph, who are among the greatest
  of J.&nbsp;S. Bach's forerunners, Johann Christoph being now supposed
  (although this is still disputed) to be the author of the splendid motet,
  <i>Ich lasse dich nicht</i> ("I wrestle and pray"), formerly ascribed to
  Sebastian Bach. Another descendant of Veit Bach, Johann Ludwig, was
  admired more than any other ancestor by Sebastian, who copied twelve of
  his church cantatas and sometimes added work of his own to them.</p>

  <p>The Bach family never left Thuringia until the sons of Sebastian went
  into a more modern world. Through all the misery of the peasantry at the
  period of the Thirty Years' War this clan maintained its position and
  produced musicians who, however local their fame, were among the greatest
  in Europe. So numerous and so eminent were they that in Erfurt musicians
  were known as "Bachs," even when there were no longer any members of the
  family in the town. Sebastian Bach thus inherited the artistic tradition
  of a united family whose circumstances had deprived them of the
  distractions of the century of musical fermentation which in the rest of
  Europe had destroyed polyphonic music.</p>

  <p>Johann Sebastian Bach was baptized at Eisenach on the 23rd <span
  class="sidenote">Biography.</span> of March 1685. His parents died in his
  tenth year, and his elder brother, Johann Christoph, organist at Ohrdruf,
  took charge of him and taught him music. The elder brother is said to
  have been jealous of Sebastian's talent, and to have forbidden him access
  to a manuscript volume of works by Froberger, Buxtehude and other great
  organists. Every night for six months Sebastian got up, put his hand
  through the lattice of the bookcase, and copied the volume out by
  moonlight, to the permanent ruin of his eyesight (as is shown by all the
  extant portraits of him at a later age and by the blindness of his last
  years). When he had finished, his brother discovered the copy and took it
  away from him. In 1700 Sebastian, now fifteen and thrown on his own
  resources by the death of his brother, went to Lüneburg, where his
  beautiful soprano voice obtained him an appointment at the school of St
  Michael as chorister. He seems, however, to have worked more at
  instrumental than at vocal music. Apart from the choristers' routine, his
  position provided only for his general education, and we know little
  about his definite musical instructors. In any case he owed his musical
  development mainly to his own incessant study of classical and
  contemporary composers, such as Frescobaldi (<i>c.</i> 1587), Caspar Kerl
  (1628-1693), Buxtehude, Froberger, Muffat the elder, Pachelbel and
  probably Johann Joseph Fux (1660-1741), the author of the <i>Gradus ad
  Parnassum</i> on which all later classical composers were trained. A
  prettier and no less authentic story than that of his brother's forbidden
  organ-volume tells how, on his return from one of the many holiday
  expeditions which Bach made to Hamburg on foot to hear the great Dutch
  organist Reinken, he sat outside an inn longing for the dinner he could
  not afford, when two herring-heads were flung out of the window, and he
  found in each of them a ducat with which he promptly paid his way, not
  home, but back to Hamburg. At Hamburg, also, Keiser was laying the
  foundations of German opera on a splendid scale which must have fired
  Bach's imagination though it never directly influenced his style. On the
  other hand Keiser's church music was of immense importance in his
  development. In Celle the famous <i>Hofkapelle</i> brought the influence
  of French music to bear upon Bach's art, an influence which inspired
  nearly all his works in suite-form and to which his many autograph copies
  of Couperin's music bear testimony. Indeed, there is no branch of music,
  from Palestrina onwards, conceivably accessible in Bach's time, of which
  we do not find specimens carefully copied in his own handwriting. On the
  other hand, when Bach, at the age of nineteen, became organist at
  Arnstadt, he found Lübeck within easy distance, and there, in October
  1705, he went to hear Buxtehude, whose organ works show so close an
  affinity to Bach's style that only their lack of coherence as wholes
  reveals to the attentive listener that with all their nobility they are
  not by Bach himself. Bach's enthusiasm for Buxtehude caused him to
  outstay his leave by three months, and this, together with his <!-- Page
  125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[v.03
  p.0125]</span>habit of astonishing the congregation by the way he
  harmonized the chorales got him into trouble. But he was already too
  great an ornament to be lightly dismissed; and though his answers to the
  complaints of the authorities (every word of which makes amusing reading
  in the archives of the church) were spirited rather than satisfactory,
  and the <i>consistorium</i> had to add to their complaints the grave
  scandal of his allowing a "strange maiden" to sing in the church,<a
  name="FnAnchor_121" href="#Footnote_121"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Bach was able
  to maintain his position at Arnstadt until he obtained the organistship
  of St Blasius in Mühlhausen in 1707. Here he married his cousin, easily
  identified with the "strange maiden" of Arnstadt; and here he wrote his
  first great church cantatas, <i>Aus der Tiefe</i>, <i>Gott ist mein
  König</i> and <i>Gottes Zeit</i>.</p>

  <p>Bach's mastery of the keyboard attracted universal attention, and
  prevented his ever being unemployed. In 1708 he went to Weimar where his
  successes were crowned by his appointment, in 1714, at the age of
  twenty-nine, as <i>Hofkonzertmeister</i> to the duke of Weimar. Here the
  composition of sacred music was one of his most congenial duties, and the
  great cantata, <i>Ich hatte viel Bekümmerniss</i>, was probably the first
  work of his new office. In 1717 Bach visited Dresden in the course of a
  concert tour, and was induced to challenge the arrogant French organist,
  J. Louis Marchand, who was making himself thoroughly disliked by the
  German musicians who could not deny his powers. Bach was first given an
  opportunity of listening secretly to Marchand's playing, then a
  competition on the organ was proposed, and a day was fixed for the
  tournament at which all the court and all the musical celebrities of the
  town were to be present, to see nothing less than the issue between
  French and German music. Marchand took up the challenge contemptuously,
  but it would appear that he also was allowed to listen secretly to Bach's
  playing, for on the day of the tournament the only news of him was that
  he had left Dresden by the earliest coach.</p>

  <p>This triumph was followed by Bach's appointment as
  <i>Kapellmeister</i> to the duke of Cöthen, a post which he held from
  1717 to 1723. The Cöthen period is that of Bach's central instrumental
  works, such as the first book of the <i>Wohltemperirtes Klavier</i>, the
  solo violin and violoncello sonatas, the Brandenburg concertos, and the
  French and English suites.</p>

  <p>In 1723, finding his position at Cöthen uninspiring for choral music,
  he removed to Leipzig, where he became cantor of the Thomasschule, being
  still able to retain his post as visiting <i>Kapellmeister</i> at Cöthen,
  besides a similar position at Weissenfels. His wife had died in 1720,
  leaving seven children, of whom Friedermann and Philipp Emanuel had a
  great future before them. (For his sons see <span class="sc">Bach,
  K.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E.</span>, below.) In December 1721 Bach married again, and for the
  beautiful soprano voice of his second wife he wrote many of his most
  inspired arias. She was a great help to him with all his work, and her
  musical handwriting soon became so like his own that her copies are
  difficult to distinguish from his autographs. In 1729 Bach heard that
  Handel was for a second time visiting Halle on his way back to London
  from Italy. A former attempt of Bach's to meet Handel had failed, and now
  he was too ill to travel, so he sent his son to Halle to invite Handel to
  Leipzig; but the errand was not successful, and much to Bach's
  disappointment he never met his only compeer. Bach so admired Handel that
  he made a manuscript copy of his <i>Passion nach Brockes</i>. This work,
  though almost unknown in England then as now, was, next to the oratorios
  of Keiser, incomparably the finest Passion then accessible, as Graun's
  beautiful masterpiece, <i>Der Tod Jesu</i>, was not composed until four
  years after Bach's death. The disgusting poem of Brockes (which was set
  by every German composer of the time) was transformed by Bach with real
  literary skill as the groundwork of the non-scriptural numbers in his
  <i>Passion according to St John</i>.</p>

  <p>All Bach's most colossal achievements, such as the <i>Passion
  according to St Matthew</i> and the <i>B Minor Mass</i> (for discussion
  of which see <span class="sc">Oratorio</span> and <span
  class="sc">Mass</span>), date from his cantorship at Leipzig. But,
  important and congenial as was his position there, and smooth as the
  course of his life seems to have been until his death in 1750, he must
  have had quite as much experience as can have been good for him. He was
  often ruffled by the town councillors of Leipzig, who (like his earlier
  employers at Arnstadt) were shocked by the "unecclesiastical style" of
  his compositions and by his independent bearing. But he had more serious
  troubles. Of his seven children by his first wife only three survived
  him. By his second wife he had thirteen children, of whom he lost four of
  the six sons. For the head of so large a family his post was dignified
  rather than lucrative, and few documents tell a prouder tale of
  uncomplaining thrift than the inventory of his possessions made after his
  death. One can only be thankful that he did not live to see anything but
  the wonderful promise of his son Friedermann, who, in the words of the
  brilliantly successful K. Philipp Emanuel Bach, was more nearly capable
  of replacing his father than all the rest of the family together. The
  prospect of complete loss of the tradition of his own polyphonic art he
  faced with equanimity, saying of the new style, which in the hands of his
  own son, Philipp Emanuel, was soon to eclipse it for the next hundred
  years, "The art has advanced to great heights: the old style of music no
  longer pleases our modern ears." But it would have broken his heart if he
  had forseen that Friedermann Bach was to attain a disreputable old age
  after a dissolute and unproductive life.</p>

  <p>The brilliant successes of Philipp Emanuel led to his appointment as
  court-composer to the king of Prussia and hence, in 1747, to Sebastian's
  being summoned to visit Frederick the Great at Potsdam, an incident which
  Bach always regarded as the culmination of his career, much as Dr Johnson
  regarded his interview with George III. Bach had to play on the numerous
  newly invented pianofortes of Silbermann which the king had bought, and
  also to try the organs of the churches of Potsdam. Frederick, whose
  musical reputation rested on a genuine if narrow basis, gave him a
  splendid theme on which to extemporize; and on that theme Bach afterwards
  wrote <i>Das musikalische Opfer</i>. Two years after this event his sight
  began to fail, and before long he shared the fate of Handel in becoming
  perfectly blind.<a name="FnAnchor_122"
  href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Bach died of apoplexy on the 28th of July 1750. His loss was deplored
  as that of one of the greatest organists and clavier players of his time.
  Of his compositions comparatively little was known. At his death his MS.
  works were divided amongst his sons, and many of them have been lost;
  only a small fraction of his greater works was recovered when, after the
  lapse of nearly a century, the verdict of his neglectful posterity was
  reversed by the modern upholders of polyphonic art. Even now some
  important works are still apparently irrecoverable.</p>

  <p>The rediscovery of Bach is closely connected with the name <span
  class="sidenote">Work and influence.</span> of Mendelssohn, who was
  amongst the first to proclaim by word and deed the powers of a genius too
  gigantic to be grasped by three generations. By the enthusiastic
  endeavours of Mendelssohn, Schumann and others, and in England still
  earlier by the performances and publications of Wesley and Crotch, the
  circle of Bach's worshippers rapidly increased. In 1850, a century after
  his death, a society was started for the correct publication of all
  Bach's remaining works. Robert Franz, the great song-writer, did good
  service in arranging some of Bach's finest works for modern performance,
  until the experience of a purer scholarship could prove not only the
  possibility but the incomparably greater beauty of a strict adherence to
  Bach's own scoring. The Porson of Bach-scholarship, however, is Wilhelm
  Rust (grandson of the interesting composer of that name who wrote
  polyphonic suites and fantasias early in the 19th century). During the
  fourteen years of his editorship of the <i>Bach-Gesellschaft</i> he
  displayed a steadily increasing insight into Bach's style which has never
  since been rivalled. In more than one case he has restored harmonies of
  priceless value from incomplete texts, by means of research and reasoning
  which he sums up in a modest footnote that reads as something
  self-evident. His prefaces to the <i>Bach-Gesellschaft</i> volumes are
  perhaps the most valuable contributions to the criticism of 18th-century
  music ever written, Spitta's great biography not excepted.</p>

<p><!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[v.03 p.0126]</span></p>

  <p>Bach's importance in the history of music cannot be exaggerated. His
  art, neglected as old-fashioned and crabbed by his younger
  contemporaries, survived only in certain limited aspects as the subject
  of a desultory and unintelligent academic study, until its re-discovery
  by Mendelssohn. And yet, whatever disguise may have been foisted on it by
  corrupt traditions and ignorance of its idioms, whenever any fragment of
  it gained the inner ear of a true composer the effect on the history of
  music was immediate and profound. Indeed his influence is by no means
  chiefly manifested in the time when his work became known in its larger
  aspects, though the Bach-revival is very obviously connected with certain
  tendencies in the "Romantic" movement in music. But, however clear we may
  consider Bach's claim to the title of "the first of Romanticists," the
  full influence of his whole work has hardly yet begun to show itself.
  Schumann died before even such enthusiasts as the editors of the
  <i>Bach-Gesellschaft</i> began to find more beauty than extravagance in
  Bach's ordinary musical language (see, for example, Hauptmann's letters
  <i>passim</i>, <i>The Letters of a Leipzig Cantor</i>, trans. by A.&nbsp;D.
  Coleridge, London, Novello, Ewer, 1892), or, indeed, to grasp the main
  features of his designs.<a name="FnAnchor_123"
  href="#Footnote_123"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The labours of the
  <i>Bach-Gesellschaft</i> have occupied more than fifty years, during
  which about four-fifths of Bach's choral works have been published for
  the first time; and it would be surprising if another fifty years
  sufficed to make these adequately known to the world at large. It is
  difficult to make an anthology of such bulky works as church-cantatas,
  nor does an anthology meet the purpose where the whole work so constantly
  attains that excellence for which the anthologist seeks. Except for
  practical difficulties (as when Bach writes for obsolete instruments) the
  only reason why some cantatas are better known than others is that a
  beginning must be made somewhere. Indeed, a cantata was recently
  selected, on the ground of its popularity, for a choral competition in a
  small English country town the year before it was performed as a novelty
  in Berlin!</p>

  <p>It is clear, then, that the influence of Bach's art as an understood
  whole is still undeveloped. In the past history of music his part was
  hardly suspected except by the great composers themselves; and, to any
  one contemplating the art of the generation after him, it might have
  seemed that both he and Handel had worked in vain. Yet his was the most
  subtle and universal force in the development of music, even when his
  musical language seemed hopelessly forgotten. Mozart, when rapidly
  advancing to the height of his mastery, had but to read the Baron von
  Swieten's manuscript copies of the motets and of the <i>Wohltemperirtes
  Klavier</i>, and his style, quite apart from his immediate essays in the
  old art-forms, and apart also from the influence of his study of Handel,
  developed a new polyphonic richness and depth of harmony which steadily
  increased until his untimely death. Beethoven studied all the accessible
  works of Bach profoundly, and frequently quoted them in his sketch-books,
  often with a direct bearing on his own works. His rendering of the
  <i>Wohltemperirtes Klavier</i> is said to be recorded in the marks of
  expression and <i>tempo</i> given in Czerny's edition; and if that record
  is true, Beethoven must have been completely in the dark as to Bach's
  meaning in many important respects; but art is full of such illustrations
  of the way in which great minds influence each other in spite of every
  barrier which diversity of language and time can set. Beethoven's great
  Thirty-three Variations on a Waltz by Diabelli were actually described in
  the publisher's puff as worthy of their kinship with the "Goldberg
  Variations" of Bach; and that kinship is revealed in its truest light by
  a comparison between Beethoven's 31st variation and Bach's 25th; for
  here, just where the resemblance is most obvious, each composer utters
  his most intimate expression of feeling.</p>

  <p>In the same way, Chopin is nowhere more characteristic than where he
  shows his love of the <i>Wohltemperirtes Klavier</i> in his Études and
  Preludes; and so subtle is the influence of polyphonic style even over a
  writer so little apt to make direct use of it as Chopin, that one of
  Schumann's few plagiarisms occurs in his use of a phrase from Chopin's F
  minor Étude (written for the <i>Méthode des méthodes</i>) as the subject
  of a fugue (Op. 72, No. 3). And, apart from fugues, which Schumann
  cultivated assiduously at a late stage in his career, the influence of
  Bach pervades the texture and rhythm of his work in more ways than can
  easily be followed.</p>

  <p>In a more external, but not less significant way, the <i>Passion
  according to St Matthew</i> made its mark on Mendelssohn from the time
  when he discovered it at the age of twelve, and suggested to him many
  features in the general design of oratorios, by means of which he rescued
  that branch of art from the operatic influences that ruined Beethoven's
  <i>Mount of Olives</i>. Without the example of Bach, Wagner's schemes of
  <i>Leitmotif</i> would never in his lifetime have become woven into that
  close polyphonic texture which secures for his music a flow as continuous
  as that of drama itself:&mdash;and intimately connected with this is the
  whole subject of Wagner's harmonization, which in many of its boldest
  characteristics was foreshadowed by Bach. A close study of the texture of
  Brahms's work shows that he develops Bach's and Beethoven's artistic
  devices <i>pari passu</i>, and that the result is a complete unification
  of that opposition between polyphony and form which in the infancy of the
  sonata (as in every transitional stage in musical history) threatened to
  wreck the art as a false antithesis wrecks a philosophy. Perhaps the only
  great composers who escaped the direct influence of Bach are Gluck and
  Berlioz. Even Gluck reproduced in every detail of harmony and figure the
  first twelve bars of the <i>Gigue</i> of Bach's B flat Clavier-Partita in
  the aria "Je t'implore et je tremble" in <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i>. But
  plagiarism, however unconscious, is a very different thing from that
  profound indebtedness which makes a great man attain his truest
  originality; and Gluck's training practically deprived him of Bach's
  direct influence, useful as that would have been to the attainment of his
  aims in harmonic and choral expression. The indirect influence no one
  could escape, for whatever in modern music is not traceable to Sebastian
  Bach is traceable to his sons, who were encouraged by their father in the
  cultivation of those infant art-forms which were so soon to dazzle the
  world into the belief that his own work was obsolete.</p>

  <p>Bach's place in music is thus far higher than that of a reformer, or
  even of an inventor of new forms. He is a spectator of all musical time
  and existence, to whom it is not of the smallest importance whether a
  thing be new or old, so long as it is true. It is doubtful whether even
  the forms most peculiar to him (such as the arpeggio-prelude) are of his
  invention. Yet he left no form as he found it,&mdash;not even that most
  conventional of all, the Da Capo Aria, which he did not outwardly alter
  in the least. On the other hand, with every form he touched he said the
  last word. All the material that could be assimilated into a mature art
  he vitalized in his own way, and he had no imitators. The language of
  music changed at his death, and his influence became all-pervading just
  because he was not the prophet of the new art, but an unbiassed seeker of
  truth. Whether so great a man becomes "progressive" or "reactionary"
  depends on the artistic resources of his time. He will always work at the
  kind of art that is most complete and consistent in all its aspects. The
  same spirit of truthfulness that makes Sebastian Bach hold himself aloof
  from the progressive art which he encourages in his sons, drives
  Beethoven to invent new forms and new means of expression with every work
  he writes. Gluck abolished the Da Capo Aria, because it was unfit for
  dramatic music. Bach did not abolish it, because he did not intend to
  write dramatic music in the strict sense of the term. Mature musical art
  in Bach's time could not be dramatic, except in the loose sense in which
  the term may be applied to an epic poem. Dramatic expression, properly so
  called, can only be attained in music by the full development of
  resources that do not blend with those of Bach's art at all. Meanwhile
  there are many things unsuitable for the stage which are nevertheless
  valuable on purely musical grounds; and the Da Capo Aria was one. Bach
  <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[v.03
  p.0127]</span>developed it in a great variety of ways, while retaining
  even the minor details of what in other hands had long before become its
  conventional form; but the one thing he did not do was to abuse it
  according to time-honoured custom as the staple form for opera. For that
  he had too much dramatic insight. His treatment of other important
  art-forms is illustrated in the articles on <span class="sc">Contrapuntal
  Forms</span>; <span class="sc">Concerto</span> and <span
  class="sc">Instrumentation</span>. Here we may attempt to illustrate his
  methods by such forms and characteristics as cannot be classified under
  those headings.</p>

  <p>1. The toccatas of Buxtehude and his predecessors show how <span
  class="sidenote">Illustrations of Bach's method.</span> an effective
  musical scheme may be suggested by running over the keyboard of an organ
  as if to try (<i>toccare</i>) the touch, then bursting out into sustained
  and full harmony, and at last settling down to a fugue. But before Bach
  no one seemed able to keep the fugue in motion long enough to make a
  convincing climax. Very soon it collapsed and the process of
  quasi-extemporization began again, to culminate in a new fugue which
  often gave the whole work a happy but deceptive suggestion of organic
  unity by being founded on an ingenious variation of the subject of the
  first fugue. But in Bach's hands the toccata becomes one of the noblest
  and most plastic of forms. The introductory runs may be disjointed and
  exaggerated to grotesqueness, until the gaps between them gradually fill
  out, and they build themselves up into grand piles of musical
  architecture, as in the organ toccata in C; or they may be worked out on
  an enormous scale in long and smooth canonic passages with a definite
  theme, as in the greatest of all toccatas, that in F for organ, which is
  most artistically followed by a fugue unusually quiet for its size. In
  one instance, the toccata at the beginning of the E minor
  clavier-partita, the introductory runs, though retaining much of the
  extempore character from which the form derives its name, take shape in a
  highly organized and rounded-off group of contrasted themes. The fugue
  follows without change of time, and is developed in so leisurely a manner
  that it is fully as long as a normal fugue on a large scale by the time
  it reaches what sounds like its central episode. At this point some of
  the introductory matter quietly enters, and leads to a recapitulation of
  the whole introduction in the key now reached. The obvious sequel would
  be a counter-development of the fugue, at least as long as what has gone
  before, as in the clavier-toccata in C minor; but Bach does not choose to
  weary the hearer and weaken the impression of breadth he has already made
  here. Instead, he expands this restatement of the introduction, and makes
  its harmonies deliberately return to the fundamental key, and thus in an
  astonishingly short time the toccata is brought to a close with the
  utmost effect of climax and finality. The same grasp of all the possible
  meanings of an artistic device shows itself in his treatment of the other
  features of toccata form. With his variety of proportion and flow he has
  no need to break off the fugue like earlier composers: but all the old
  devices by which the division into sections was managed are turned to
  account by him, and almost every toccata has its own scheme of contrasted
  movements, always based on the old natural idea of the growth of an
  organized music from a chaos of extemporization.</p>

  <p>If this is Bach's treatment of a comparatively small and specialized
  art-form, it is obviously impossible to reduce the scantiest account of
  the rest of his work into practical limits here, nor is there as yet a
  sufficient body of accepted criticism of Bach for such an account to
  carry further conviction than an expression of individual opinion.
  Fortunately, however, Bach was constantly re-arranging his own
  compositions; indeed he evidently regards adaptability to fresh
  environment as the test of his finest work: and we cannot do better than
  review the evidence thus given to us,&mdash;evidence which only
  Beethoven's sketch-books surpass in significance.</p>

  <p>2. The successful transplanting of a work of art to a fresh
  environment is obviously a convincing test of our definitions of the
  art-forms concerned, if only we take care to distinguish between the
  alterations produced by the change of environment and those that imply
  the composer's dissatisfaction with the original version. In Bach's case
  this seldom causes much difficulty; his methods of adaptation are so
  logical and so varied as to form a scheme of musical morphology with all
  the interest and none of the imperfections of the geological record; and
  the few cases in which a work owes its changes to the need for
  improvement as well as adaptation cause no confusion, but rather form a
  link between the pure adaptations and the numerous revisions of his
  favourite works without change of medium. There is, for example, no
  difficulty in separating the element of corrective criticism from that of
  the impulse to give an already successful composition a larger or more
  permanent form, in such cases as the transformations undergone by the
  movements of the birthday cantata, <i>Was mir behagt ist nur die muntre
  Jagd</i>, during their distribution among the church cantatas, <i>Also
  hat Gott die Welt geliebt</i> and <i>Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg</i>.
  The fine bass aria, "Ein Fürst ist seines Landes Pan," was obviously
  ill-proportioned, with its breakneck return to the tonic and its
  perfunctory close; and Bach's chief concern in adapting it for its place
  as the aria, "Du bist geboren mir zu Gute," in <i>Also hat Gott</i>, was
  to remedy this defect. On the other hand, the use of the delightful
  ritornello for violoncello from the little aria, "Weil die wollenreichen
  Heerden," in the birthday cantata, and the restoration of the rejected
  long instrumental <i>fugato</i> that was to follow, were obviously
  brought about by the conception of the entirely new material for the
  voice in the famous aria, "Mein gläubiges Herze." And when the last
  chorus of <i>Was mir behagt</i> became the first chorus of <i>Man singet
  mit Freuden</i>, it was expanded to the proportions necessary for a
  triumphant opening (as distinguished from a cheerful finale) by the
  adroit insertion of new material between every joint in the design. This
  material, being new, could not produce the effect of diffuseness that
  would result from the expansion of the old material already complete in
  its simplest form, and thus this instance does not imply criticism.</p>

  <p>A highly interesting example of pure self-criticism is the <i>Passion
  according to St John</i>, which was twice revised, and each time reduced
  to a smaller scale by the omission of some of its finest numbers. The
  final result was a work of perfect proportions, and of the rejected
  numbers one (a magnificent aria with chorale) remained unused, two were
  replaced by finer substitutes, others took shape as one of the most
  complete and remarkable of the church cantatas, <i>Du wahrer Gott</i>,
  while the greatest of the figured chorales was transferred to the
  <i>Passion according to St Matthew</i>, of which it now crowns the first
  part.</p>

  <p>3. Such instances of self-criticism might be paralleled in the works
  of other composers; but there is no parallel in music to Bach's power of
  reproducing already perfect works in different media. Here Bach reveals
  to us identities in difference which we should otherwise never have
  suspected. Of course it is possible to arrange works in different ways
  without illustrating any profound identities at all. Handel, for
  instance, collected several of his favourite choruses in an enormous
  instrumental concerto (see vol. 46 of the <i>Händel-Gesellschaft</i>),
  and the result in the case of a chorus like "Lift up your Heads" was
  ridiculous. Bach, however, does not arrange old work merely to please a
  court where it was already admired. He never leaves it in a state of mere
  make-shift, though he cannot always attain his evident aim of a new
  originality. His methods of orchestration and the profoundly significant
  identity of certain forms of chorus with certain concerto forms may
  better be described under their proper headings (see articles <span
  class="sc">Instrumentation</span> and <span class="sc">Concerto</span>).
  Here we will attempt first to show, by illustrations of Bach's power of
  adding parts to already complete harmonic and contrapuntal schemes, what
  was his conception of the nature of an art-form, and secondly, by means
  of a short analysis of cases in which he adapts the same music to
  different words, to define his range of expression.</p>

  <p>Bach arranged all his violin concertos for clavier, including two that
  are lost in the original version. Here his power of providing new and
  apparently necessary material for the left hand of the cembalist (or, in
  the double concertos, two left <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>[v.03 p.0128]</span>hands) without disturbing the
  already complete score, is astonishing; and it fails only in the slow
  movements, which he prefers to leave obviously in the condition of an
  arrangement rather than to spoil their broad cantabile style by a too
  polyphonic bass.</p>

  <p>But these cases are insignificant compared with such transformations
  as that of the prelude of the E major partita for unaccompanied violin
  into the sinfonia for organ obligato accompanied by full orchestra
  (including three trumpets and a pair of drums) at the beginning of the
  church cantata, <i>Wir danken dir, Gott.</i> The original version is
  perhaps the most complete and natural of the violin solos, for its
  arpeggios produce full harmony without recourse to that constant attempt
  to play on all four strings at once, which makes the performance of the
  polyphonic movements a <i>tour de force</i> in which steady rhythm is
  nearly impossible. Yet in the sinfonia its proportions seem to reveal
  themselves for the first time. Not a bar is displaced and not a note of
  the new accompaniment is unnecessary. The whole is almost entirely
  without themes; for even this, the largest of all arpeggio-preludes,
  consists essentially of the gradual unfolding of a scheme of harmony in
  which rhythmic and melodic organization is reduced to a minimum. Only in
  the first line does the incisive initial figure persist a little longer
  in the new accompaniment than in the original solo, but on the last page
  it reappears and pervades the whole orchestra, even the drums thundering
  out its rhythm at the climax where the holding-notes of the trumpet span
  the torrent of harmony like a rainbow.</p>

  <p>Deeper still is the thought that underlies the transformation of two
  movements of the great violin-concerto in D minor (unfortunately lost
  except in its splendid arrangement for clavier) into parts of the church
  cantata, <i>Wir müssen durch viel Trübsal in das Reich Gottes
  eingehen</i>. In both movements the violin is replaced by the organ an
  octave lower, the orchestral accompaniment remaining where it was. This
  treatment, with the addition of new and plaintive parts for wind
  instruments, turns the already very long and sombre first movement into
  an impressive idealization of the "much tribulation" that lies between us
  and the kingdom of heaven. The slow movement is still more solemn, and is
  arranged in the same way as regards the instruments; but from the first
  note to the last a four-part chorus sings, to the words of the title, a
  mass of quite new material (except for the bass and for numerous
  imitations of the solo-part), treated with every variety of vocal
  colouring and a grandeur of conception which is not dwarfed even by the
  <i>Passion according to St Matthew.</i></p>

  <p>4. The four short masses, the Christmas oratorio and the B minor mass,
  contain every variety of adaptation from earlier work. The four short
  masses are indeed obviously compiled for use in a church where the
  orchestra was small. Only four movements in the whole collection are not
  traceable to other extant works; all the rest comes from church cantatas.
  The adaptations are not always significant; no attempt, for example, is
  made in the G minor mass to conceal how unfit for a <i>Kyrie eleison</i>
  is the tremendous denunciatory chorus, <i>Herr, deine Augen sehen nach
  dem Glauben</i>. But the F major and G major masses are very instructive;
  and the A major mass, except for the damage done to the instrumentation,
  is a work that no one would conceive to be not original. The Kyrie is one
  of Bach's most individual utterances and could surely never have fitted
  any other text, but we should say the same of the Gloria if we did not
  possess the church cantata, <i>Halt im Gedächtniss</i>. The Gloria begins
  with a triumphant polyphonic chorus accompanied by a spirited symphony
  for strings. At the words "et in terra pax" the time changes, and two
  flutes softly accompany a single solemn melody in the altos. At the
  "laudamus te" the material of the beginning returns, and is interrupted
  again by the calm slow movement, this time in another key and for another
  voice, at the words "adoramus te." Twice the "laudamus" and "adoramus"
  alternate in a finely proportioned design; at last the words "gratias
  agimus tibi propter magnam gloriam tuam" are set for the full chorus to
  the music of the slow movement, the strings join with the flutes, and
  this most appropriate setting of those words is finished. And yet it is
  quite impossible to regard this as superseding the last chorus of <i>Halt
  im Gedächtniss</i>. Not one bar or harmony of the framework differs; yet
  the two versions are two independent works of art. In the cantata the
  beginning is for instruments only; when the slow movement (here
  adequately scored for a flute and two <i>oboe d' amore</i>) begins, the
  basses, permanently separated from the rest of the chorus, sing "Peace be
  unto you." The other voices then sing the triumph of the faithful helped
  by the Saviour in their battle against the world. The slow movement is,
  of course, set for bass alone throughout, and at the last recurrence of
  the <i>allegro</i> the bass continues to sing "Friede sei mit euch"
  through the rest of the chorus, as if leading the chorus of humanity
  through strife to the kingdom of heaven, and then the single voice of
  peace remains to the end. Hardly a bar of the chorus-material is on the
  same themes in the two versions.</p>

  <p>The study of the sources of the Christmas oratorio will complete the
  evidence on which we support our estimate of Bach's methods and range of
  expression. It is certain that the occasional cantatas, from which all
  except the chorale-tune numbers and those set to words from the Bible
  were taken, date from shortly before the oratorio; and that Bach, being
  incapable of putting inferior work even into birthday odes, rescued it
  from oblivion by having the verses for the oratorio numbers built on the
  same rhythms as those of the odes in order that he might use those
  occasional works as a sketch (see <i>B.-G.</i>, <i>Jahr.</i> xxxiv.
  preface). Be this as it may, the alterations are confined to details even
  where an aria is transposed a fourth or fifth; but the effect of them is
  startling. Pleasure (Wollust) sings a lovely soprano aria to allure
  Hercules from the paths of Virtue, to which Hercules replies indignantly
  with an aria in a spirited staccato style. It is no doubt a shock to our
  feelings to find that Wollust's aria became the Virgin's cradle-song,
  while Hercules's reply became the alto aria in which Zion is bidden to
  "prepare for the Bridegroom." But it does not warrant the inference that
  Bach's music lacks definite characterization: on the contrary, these two
  arias are the best demonstration of his profound insight into the
  possibilities of musical expression within his range. It is no part of
  his conception of art that Wollust should be represented by a Wagnerian
  Venusberg-music; the obvious way to represent Pleasure was by writing
  pleasant music, and with Bach's ideas of pleasance the step from this to
  the solemn beauty of the sacred cradle-song was a mere matter of change
  of colour and <i>tempo</i>. The key is lowered from B flat to G, the
  strings are veiled with the tender reed tone of a group of <i>oboe d'
  amore</i>, the soprano becomes an alto whose notes are, as it were,
  surrounded with a nimbus by being doubled in the upper octave by a flute;
  and the aria becomes worthy of its new purpose, not by losing a grossness
  which it never possessed, but by gaining the richness which distinguishes
  the perfect work from the boldly executed draft.</p>

  <p>As to the aria of Hercules the change is in manner, while the
  character, in the human sense of the term, is quite rightly the same.
  Both Hercules and the faithful Christian of the oratorio are renouncing
  pomps and vanities for the claims of a higher life; in the one case
  indignantly, in the other case inspired "mit zärtlichem Triebe." A change
  to a <i>legato</i> style, the substitution of a single <i>oboe d'
  amore</i> for <i>tutti</i> violins, the addition of delicate ornaments
  indicative of a slower pace, and the noble stream of melody preserve its
  identity while changing its aspect. Bach's larger designs react on their
  changing contents as a cathedral reacts on the impressiveness of the
  rites performed within it, or as nature reacts on a poet's thoughts; and
  in the same way Bach's melody is greater than any possible mood of the
  moment, not because of that vague and negative pseudo-classical quality
  misnamed "reserve," but because of its vital individuality. In their
  proper directions its changes are limitless; elsewhere change is
  inconceivable. No amount of "Umarbeitung" could, for instance, turn the
  aria of Hercules into the Virgin's cradle-song, or Wollust's aria into
  the exhortation of Zion to prepare for the Bridegroom. In short, Bach's
  melodies are characteristic, not like a mask with a set expression, but
  like a living face that is the more individual for the mobility of its
  features.</p>

<p><!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>[v.03 p.0129]</span></p>

  <p>Within these limits, that is, short of dramatic expression in just so
  far as "the end of drama is not character but action," there is nothing
  good that Bach's art does not express. He has plenty of humour, if the
  term may be applied to art which is, so to speak, always
  literal,&mdash;art in which a jest is a jest and serious things are
  treated with familiar directness, and all, whether in jest or earnest, is
  primarily beautiful. In <i>Der Streit zwischen Phoebus und Pan</i> Bach
  answers the critics who censured him for his pedantry and provincial
  ignorance of the grand Italian operatic style, by making effective use of
  that style in Pan's prize-aria ("Zum Tanze, zum Sprunge, so
  wack-ack-ack-ackelt das Herz"), nobly representing his own style in
  Phoebus's aria, and promptly caricaturing it in the second part of Pan's
  ("Wenn der Ton zu mühsam klingt"). Midas votes for Pan&mdash;"denn nach
  meinen beiden Ohren singt er unvergleichlich schön." At the word "Ohren"
  the violins give a pianissimo "hee-haw" which is fully as witty in its
  musical aptness as Mendelssohn's clown-theme in the Overture to the
  <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>; and in the ensuing dialogue their
  prophecy is verified. As with many other great artists, Bach's
  playfulness occasionally showed itself inconveniently where little things
  shock little minds. The hilarious aria, "Ermuntre dich," in the church
  cantata, <i>Schmücke dich, o liebe Seele</i>, is one instance, and the
  quaint representation of the words "dimisit inanes" in the
  <i>Magnificat</i> is another. This great work, one of the most terse and
  profound things Bach ever wrote, contains, among many other subtle
  inspirations, one conception with which we may fitly end our survey, for
  it strongly suggests Bach himself and the destiny of all that work which
  he finished so lovingly, with no prospect of its becoming more than a
  family heirloom and a salutary tradition in his Leipzig choir-school. In
  the <i>Magnificat</i> he sets the words "quia respexit humilitatem
  ancillae suae" to a touchingly appropriate soprano solo accompanied by
  his favourite <i>oboe d'amore</i>. With the next sentence "ecce enim
  beatam me dicent" the tone brightens to a quiet joy, but Bach takes
  advantage of the syntax of the Latin in a way that defies translation,
  and the sentence is finished by the chorus. "Omnes generationes" seem
  indeed to pass before us in the crowded fugue which rises in perpetual
  stretto, the incessant entries of its subject now mounting the whole
  scale, each part a step higher than the last, and now collecting in
  unison with a climax of closeness and volume overwhelming in its
  impression of time and multitude.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SUMMARY OF BACH'S WORKS</p>

  <p>No attempt is here made at chronological sequence. The changes in
  Bach's style, though clear and important, are almost impossible to
  describe in untechnical language; nor are they of such general interest
  as to make it worth while to expand this summary by an attempt to
  apportion its contents among the Arnstadt-Mühlhausen period, the Weimar
  period, the Cöthen period (chiefly remarkable for instrumental music and
  comparatively uninteresting in its easy-going choral music), and the last
  period (1733-1750) in which, while the choral works became at once more
  numerous and more terse (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Jesu, der du meine Seele</i>) the
  instrumental music, though never diffuse, shows an increasing preference
  for designs on a large scale. (Compare, for example, the second book of
  the <i>Wohltemperirtes Klavier</i>, 1744, with the first, 1722.)</p>

<p class="cenhead">I.&mdash;<span class="sc">Church Music</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">A. <i>With Orchestra</i></p>

  <p>190 church cantatas: besides several which are only known from
  fragmentary sets of parts. Of the 190, 40 are for solo voices, about 60
  (including some solo cantatas) are more or less founded on chorales, and
  the rest, though almost invariably containing a chorale (for
  congregational singing), are practically short oratorios and frequently
  so entitled by Bach himself.</p>

  <p>3 wedding cantatas: the Easter oratorio (exactly like the
  above-mentioned oratorio-cantatas; and the Christmas oratorio (six
  similar cantatas forming a connected design for performance on six
  separate days).</p>

  <p>The Passions according to St Matthew and St John.</p>

  <p>Funeral ode for the Duchess Eberhardine (now known to be arranged from
  portions of the lost Passion according to St Mark).</p>

  <p>4 short masses (<i>i.e.</i> Kyrie and Gloria only) mainly compiled
  from church cantatas.</p>

  <p>Mass in B minor. Magnificat in D. A few other ecclesiastical Latin
  choruses.</p>

<p class="cenhead">B. <i>Without Orchestra</i></p>

  <p>5 motets <i>a capella</i> (but there is reason to believe that these,
  except <i>Komm Jesu komm</i>, were intended to be partly supported by the
  organ). A sixth motet has an obligato figured-bass accompaniment.</p>

  <p>A few early choruses, mostly turned to account in later works.</p>

  <p>A large collection of plain chorales, including several original
  melodies.</p>

<p class="cenhead">II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Secular Vocal Music</span></p>

  <p><i>Der Streit zwischen Phoebus und Pan</i> and <i>Der zufrieden
  gestellte Aeolus</i>; both entitled <i>Dramma per Musica</i>, but showing
  no more essential connexion with the stage than Handel's <i>Acis and
  Galatea</i>.</p>

  <p>7 solo and 7 choral cantatas, of which latter three were almost
  entirely absorbed into the Christmas oratorio and the B minor mass. Of
  the solo cantatas two are Italian (one of these being Bach's only
  developed work for voice and clavier) and two are burlesque.</p>

  <p>Several tunes with clavier bass, almost foreshadowing the modern
  song.</p>

<p class="cenhead">III.&mdash;<span class="sc">Instrumental Music</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">A. <i>Orchestral</i></p>

  <p>7 clavier concertos arranged from violin concertos and other
  sources.</p>

  <p>3 concertos for two claviers (two being arranged from concertos for
  two violins).</p>

  <p>2 concertos for three claviers.</p>

  <p>The 6 Brandenburg concertos, for various combinations.</p>

  <p>2 violin concertos, and a colossal <i>torso</i> of a concerted
  violin-movement forming the prelude to a lost church cantata.</p>

  <p>1 concerto for two violins.</p>

  <p>4 orchestral suites. (The symphony in F in the same volume of the
  <i>B.&nbsp;G.</i> is only an earlier version of the first Brandenburg
  concerto.)</p>

<p class="cenhead">B. <i>Chamber Music</i></p>

  <p>3 sonatas for clavier and flute; a suite and 6 sonatas for clavier and
  violin, 3 for clavier and viola da gamba; 2 trios with figured bass; 2
  flute-sonatas and a violin suite with figured bass; 6 sonatas
  (<i>i.e.</i> 3 sonatas and 3 partitas) for violin alone; 6 suites for
  violoncello alone.</p>

<p class="cenhead">C. <i>Clavier and Organ Music</i></p>

  <p>Bach's own collections are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Das wohltemperirte Klavier</i> for clavichord: two books each
  containing 24 preludes and fugues, one in each major and minor key; with
  the object of stimulating tuning by "equal temperament" instead of
  sacrificing the euphony of remoter keys to that of the more usual
  ones.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Klavier-Übung</i> (chiefly for harpsichord) in four books
  comprising: (i.) 15 two-part inventions and 15 three-part symphonies,
  (ii.) 6 partitas, (iii.) The "Goldberg" variations. 4 duets, and an
  important collection of organ choral-preludes, with the "St Anne" prelude
  and fugue in E flat, (iv.) The Italian concerto and French overture.</p>

  <p>3. The 6 "French" and 6 "English" suites.</p>

  <p>The other clavier works fill two <i>Jahrgänge</i> of the
  <i>B.-G.</i></p>

  <p>Bach's collections of organ music are (besides that included in the
  third part of the <i>Klavier-Übung</i>):&mdash;(1) 6 sonatas. (2) 4
  groups of 6 organ preludes and fugues. (3) <i>Das Orgelbüchlein</i>, a
  collection of short choral-preludes carefully planned&mdash;all the blank
  pages of the autograph being headed with the titles of the chorales
  intended for them&mdash;but not half executed. (The projected whole would
  have been a larger volume than the <i>Wohltemperirtes Klavier</i>). (4)
  18 larger chorale-preludes, including Bach's last composition. (5) The 6
  "Schübler" chorales, all arranged from movements of cantatas.</p>

  <p>Besides these there are the three great independent toccatas and the
  Passacaglia. The remaining choral-preludes fill one <i>Jahrgang</i>, and
  the other organ works two more.</p>

<p class="cenhead">D. <i>Unclassified</i></p>

  <p>Two important instrumental works cannot be classified, viz. <i>Das
  musikalische Opfer</i>, the volume of compositions (two great fugues,
  various puzzle-canons, and a splendid trio for flute, violin and figured
  bass) on the theme given to Bach by Frederick the Great; and <i>Die Kunst
  der Fuge</i>, a progressive series of fugues on one and the same subject,
  written in open score as if entirely abstract studies, but all (except
  the extreme contrapuntal <i>tours de force</i>) in admirable clavier
  style and of great musical value.</p>

<p class="cenhead">IV.&mdash;<span class="sc">Lost Works</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">A. <i>Choral</i></p>

  <p>J. N. Forkel's statement that Bach wrote 5 <i>Jahrgange</i> of church
  cantatas (<i>i.e.</i> enough to provide one for each Sunday and holy day
  for five years) would indicate that some 80 are lost, but there is reason
  to believe that this is a great exaggeration. Not more than six or seven
  cantatas are known to be lost, by the evidence of fragments, text-books,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Forkel also says that Bach wrote five Passions. Besides the great
  Matthew and John Passions there is in an indisputable Bach autograph one
  according to St Luke; but it is so worthless that the best plea for its
  authenticity offered by responsible critics is that only a personal
  interest could have induced Bach to make a copy of it.</p>

<p><!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>[v.03 p.0130]</span></p>

  <p>The lost Passion according to St Mark must, judging by the movements
  preserved in the <i>Trauer-Ode</i>, have been larger than that according
  to St John.</p>

  <p>Was there a <i>genuine</i> Lucas-Passion? If so, Forkel's report of
  five Passions would be explained. Several lost secular works are partly
  preserved in those portions of the Christmas oratorio of which the
  sources are not definitely known, but which, like the other duplicated
  numbers, are fair copies in the autograph.</p>

<p class="cenhead">B. <i>Instrumental</i></p>

  <p>Three violin concertos and one for two violins; known only from the
  wonderful clavier versions.</p>

  <p>Most of the first movement of the A major sonata for clavier and flute
  which was written in the spare staves at the bottom of a larger score.
  Some of these have been cut off.</p>

<p class="cenhead">V.&mdash;<span class="sc">Arrangements of Works by other Composers</span></p>

  <p>Arrangements for harpsichord alone of 16 concertos, generally
  described as by Vivaldi, but including several by other composers.</p>

  <p>4 Vivaldi concertos arranged for organ.</p>

  <p>Many of these arrangements contain much original matter, such as
  entirely new slow movements, large cadenzas, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Concerto in A minor for 4 claviers and orchestra, from Vivaldi's B
  minor concerto for 4 violins. This, though the most faithful to its
  original, is the richest and most Bach-like of all these arrangements,
  and is well worth performing in public.</p>

  <p>2 sonatas from the <i>Hortus Musicus</i> of Reinken, arranged for
  clavier. (The ends of the slow movements are Bach.)</p>

  <p>Finishing touches to cantatas by his uncle Johann Ludwig Bach. Also a
  very characteristic complete "Christe eleison" inserted in Kyrie of
  Johann Ludwig's.</p>

<p class="cenhead">VI.&mdash;<span class="sc">Doubtful and Spurious Works</span></p>

  <p>Bach's autographs give the name of the composer on the outside sheet
  only. He was constantly making copies of all that interested him; and
  where the outside sheet is lost, only the music itself can tell us
  whether it is his or not. The above-mentioned <i>Passion according to St
  Luke</i> is the chief case in point. The little music-books he and his
  second wife wrote for their children are full of pieces in the most
  various styles, and the editors of the <i>Bach-Gesellschaft</i> have not
  completely identified them, even Couperin's well-known "Les Bergeries"
  escaping their scrutiny. A sonata for two claviers by Bach's eldest son,
  Wilhelm Friedermann, was detected by the editors after its inclusion in
  <i>Jahrgang</i> xliv. The second of the 3 sonatas for clavier and flute
  is extremely suggestive of Bach's sons, but Philipp Emanuel ascribes it
  to his father. However, he might easily have docketed it wrongly while
  arranging copies of his father's works. It has a twin brother
  (<i>B.-G.</i> ix. Anhang ii.) for which he has not vouched.</p>

  <p>Four absurd church cantatas are printed for conscience' sake in
  <i>Jahrgang</i> xliii. More important than these, because by no means too
  obviously ridiculous to deceive a careless listener, is the well-known
  8-part motet, <i>Lob, Ehr' und Weisheit</i> (blessing and glory and
  wisdom). A closer acquaintance shows that it is really very poor stuff;
  and it was finally crowned with absurdity by the discovery that its
  composer was a contemporary of Bach,&mdash;and that his name was
  Wagner.</p>

  <p>The beautiful motet, <i>Ich lasse dich nicht</i>, has long been known
  to be by one of Bach's uncles (Johann Christoph).</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Editions</span></p>

  <p>Almost the only works of Bach published during his lifetime were the
  instrumental collections, most of which he engraved himself. Of the
  church cantatas only one, <i>Gott ist mein König</i> (written when he was
  nineteen, but a very great work), was published in his lifetime.</p>

  <p>Of modern editions that of the <i>Bach-Gesellschaft</i> is, of course,
  the only complete one. It is, inevitably, of very unequal merit. Its
  first editors could not realize their own ignorance of Bach's language;
  their immediate admiration of his larger choruses seemed to them proof of
  their competence to retain or dismiss details of ornamentation, figured
  bass, variants between score and parts, &amp;c., without always stopping
  to see what light these might shed on questions of <i>tempo</i> and
  style&mdash;especially in the arias and recitatives, which they regarded
  as archaic almost in direct proportion to the depth of thought really
  displayed in them. In the 9th <i>Jahrgang</i> Wilhelm Rust introduced
  scholarly methods, with the happiest results. The <i>Wohltemperirtes
  Klavier (Jahrgang</i> xiv.) was edited by Kroll, who also made his text
  accessible in the <i>Edition Peters</i> (which till then had only
  Czerny's&mdash;an amazing result of corrupt tradition, still widely
  accepted). Kroll's and Rust's volumes are far the best in the
  <i>B.&nbsp;G.</i> On Rust's death the standard deteriorated; his immediate
  successor seems more interested in reprinting in full an early version of
  a work of which Rust had given only the variants, than in digesting his
  own materials (<i>Jahrgang</i> xxix.); and in his next volume
  (<i>Jahrgang</i> xxx. p. 109) the bass and violin are a bar apart for a
  whole line. The last ten volumes, however, are again satisfactory, and in
  <i>Jahrgang</i> xliv. the French and English suites are re-edited. Part
  of the B minor mass was also worked over again; and Kroll's text of the
  <i>Wohltemperirtes Klavier</i> was supplemented by the evidence of the
  British Museum autograph. The Steingräber edition of the clavier works,
  edited by Dr Hans Bischoff, is incomparably the best, giving all the
  variants in footnotes and clearly distinguishing the extremely
  intelligent nuances and phrasing signs of the editor from the rare but
  significant indications of Bach himself. Nor does this wealth of
  scholarship interfere with the presentation of a straightforward, single
  text; though in addition there is every necessary explanation of the
  ornaments and kindred matters.</p>

  <p>We have seen no other editions that distinguish Bach's text from the
  editor's taste&mdash;the disappointing publications of the <i>Neue
  Bachgesellschaft</i><a name="FnAnchor_124"
  href="#Footnote_124"><sup>[4]</sup></a> by no means excepted. We may
  remark that the older vocal scores of cantatas in the <i>Edition
  Peters</i> are, though unfortunately but a selection, far better than the
  complete series issued by Breitkopf and Härtel in conformity with the
  <i>Bach Gesellschaft</i>, and therefore accepted as authoritative (see
  <span class="sc">Instrumentation</span>). The English vocal scores
  published by Novello are generally very good though covering but small

  <p><b>BACH, KARL PHILIPP EMANUEL</b> (1714-1788), German musician and
  composer, the third son of Johann Sebastian Bach, was born at Weimar on
  the 14th of March 1714. When he was ten years old he entered the
  Thomasschule at Leipzig, of which in 1723 his father had become cantor,
  and continued his education as a student of jurisprudence at the
  universities of Leipzig (1731) and of Frankfort on the Oder (1735). In
  1738 he took his degree, but at once abandoned all prospects of a legal
  career and determined to devote himself to music. A few months later he
  obtained an appointment in the service of the crown prince of Prussia, on
  whose accession in 1740 he became a member of the royal household. He was
  by this time one of the first clavier-players in Europe, and his
  compositions, which date from 1731, included about thirty sonatas and
  concerted pieces for his favourite instrument. His reputation was
  established by the two sets of sonatas which he dedicated respectively to
  Frederick the Great (1742) and to the grand duke of Württemberg (1744);
  in 1746 he was promoted to the post of <i>Kammermusikus</i>, and for
  twenty-two years shared with Karl Heinrich, Graun, Johann Joachim, Quantz
  and Johann Gottlieb Naumann the continued favour of the king. During his
  residence at Berlin he wrote a fine setting of the <i>Magnificat</i>
  (1749), in which he shows more traces than usual of his father's
  influence, an Easter cantata (1756), several symphonies and concerted
  works, at least three volumes of songs,&mdash;<i>Geistliche Oden und
  Lieder</i>, to words by Gellert (1758), <i>Oden mit Melodien</i> (1762)
  and <i>Sing-Oden</i> (1766), and a few secular cantatas and other
  <i>pièces d'occasion</i>. But his main work was concentrated on the
  clavier, for which he composed, at this time, nearly two hundred sonatas
  and other solos, including the set <i>mit veränderten Reprisen</i>
  (1760-1768) and a few of those <i>für Kenner und Liebhaber</i>. Meanwhile
  he placed himself in the forefront of European critics by his <i>Versuch
  über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen</i> (first part 1753, second,
  with the first reprinted, 1762), a systematic and masterly treatise which
  by 1780 had reached its third edition, and which laid the foundation for
  the methods of Clementi and Cramer. In 1768 Bach succeeded Georg Philipp
  Telemann as <i>Kapellmeister</i> at Hamburg, and in consequence of his
  new office began to turn his attention more towards church music. Next
  year he produced his oratorio <i>Die Israeliten in der Wüste</i>, a
  composition remarkable not only for its great beauty but for the
  resemblance of its plan to that of Mendelssohn's <i>Elijah</i>, and
  between 1769 and 1788 added over twenty settings of the Passion, a second
  oratorio <i>Der Auferstehung <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>[v.03 p.0131]</span>und Himmelfahrt Jesu</i> (1777),
  and some seventy cantatas, litanies, motets and other liturgical pieces.
  At the same time his genius for instrumental composition was further
  stimulated by the career of Haydn, to whom he sent a letter of high
  appreciation, and the climax of his art was reached in the six volumes of
  sonatas <i>für Kenner und Liebhaber</i>, to which he devoted the best
  work of his last ten years. He died at Hamburg on the 14th of December
  1788.</p>

  <p>Through the latter half of the 18th century the reputation of K.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E.
  Bach stood very high. Mozart said of him, "He is the father, we are the
  children"; the best part of Haydn's training was derived from a study of
  his work; Beethoven expressed for his genius the most cordial admiration
  and regard. This position he owes mainly to his clavier sonatas, which
  mark an important epoch in the history of musical form. Lucid in style,
  delicate and tender in expression, they are even more notable for the
  freedom and variety of their structural design; they break away
  altogether from the exact formal antithesis which, with the composers of
  the Italian school, had hardened into a convention, and substitute the
  wider and more flexible outline which the great Viennese masters showed
  to be capable of almost infinite development. The content of his work,
  though full of invention, lies within a somewhat narrow emotional range,
  but it is not less sincere in thought than polished and felicitous in
  phrase. Again he was probably the first composer of eminence who made
  free use of harmonic colour for its own sake, apart from the movement of
  contrapuntal parts, and in this way also he takes rank among the most
  important pioneers of the school of Vienna. His name has now fallen into
  undue neglect, but no student of music can afford to disregard his
  <i>Sonaten für Kenner und Liebhaber</i>, his oratorio <i>Die Israeliten
  in der Wüste</i>, and the two concertos (in G major and D major) which
  have been republished by Dr Hugo Riemann.</p>

  <p>A list of his voluminous compositions may be found in Eitner's
  <i>Quellen Lexikon</i>, and a critical account of them is given in
  Bitter's <i>C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E. und W.&nbsp;F. Bach und deren Bruder</i> (2 vols.,
  Berlin, 1868), a mine of valuable though ill-arranged information.</p>

  <p>Four more of Johann Sebastian Bach's sons grew to manhood and became
  musicians. The eldest of them, <span class="sc">Wilhelm Friedermann
  Bach</span> (1710-1784) was by common repute the most gifted; a famous
  organist, a famous improvisor and a complete master of counterpoint. But,
  unlike the rest of the family, he was a man of idle and dissolute habits,
  whose career was little more than a series of wasted opportunities.
  Educated at Leipzig, he was appointed in 1733 organist of the
  Sophienkirche at Dresden, and in 1747 became musical director of the
  Liebfrauenkirche at Halle. The latter office he was compelled to resign
  in 1764, and thenceforward he led a wandering life until, on the 1st of
  July 1784, he died in great poverty at Berlin. His compositions, very few
  of which were printed, include many church cantatas and instrumental
  works, of which the most notable are the fugues, polonaises and fantasias
  for clavier, and an interesting sestet for strings, clarinet and horns.
  Several of his manuscripts are preserved in the Royal library at Berlin;
  and a complete list of his works, so far as they are known, may be found
  in Eitner's <i>Quellen Lexikon</i>.</p>

  <p>The fourth son, <span class="sc">Johann Gottfried Bernhard Bach</span>
  (1715-1739) was, like his elder brothers, born at Weimar and educated at
  Leipzig. From 1735 to 1738 he held successively the organistships at
  Mühlhausen and Sangerhausen; in 1738 he threw up his appointment and went
  to study law at Jena; in 1739 he died, aged 24.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach</span> (1732-1795),
  the ninth son, was born at Leipzig, studied at the Thomasschule and the
  university, and in 1750 was appointed <i>Kapellmeister</i> at Bückeburg.
  He was an industrious composer, especially of church-music and opera,
  whose work reflects no discredit on the family name.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Johann Christian Bach</span> (1735-1782), the
  eleventh son, was born at Leipzig, and on the death of his father in 1750
  became the pupil of his brother Emanuel at Berlin. In 1754 he went to
  Italy where he studied under Padre Martini, and from 1760 to 1762 held
  the post of organist at Milan cathedral, for which he wrote two Masses, a
  <i>Requiem</i>, a <i>Te Deum</i> and other works. Having also gained some
  reputation as a composer of opera, he was in 1762 invited to London and
  there spent the rest of his life. For twenty years he was the most
  popular musician in England, his dramatic works, produced at the King's
  theatre, were received with great cordiality, he was appointed
  music-master to the queen, and his concerts, given in partnership with
  Abel at the Hanover Square rooms, soon became the most fashionable of
  public entertainments. He is of some historical interest as the first
  composer who preferred the pianoforte to the older keyed-instruments; but
  his works, though elegant and pleasing, were ephemeral in character and
  have been deservedly forgotten.</p>

  <p>A full account of J.&nbsp;C. Bach's career is given in the fourth volume of
  Burney's <i>History of Music</i>, and a catalogue of his compositions in
  an article by Max Schwarz, published in the <i>Sammelbände</i> of the
  <i>Internationale Musik-Gesellschaft</i>, Jhrg. ii. p. 401.</p>

  <p><b>BACHARACH, YAIR</b> (1639-1702), German rabbi, was the author of
  <span class="special" title="Hawwoth Yair"><i>&#x1E24;awwoth
  Ya&#x12B;r</i></span> (a collection of <i>Responsa</i>) and other works.
  Bacharach was a man of wide culture, and holds an honourable place among
  the pioneers of the Jewish Renaissance which was inaugurated towards the
  end of the 18th century.</p>

  <p><b>BACHARACH,</b> a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine Province,
  romantically situated on the left bank of the Rhine, 30 m. above Coblenz
  on the railway to Mainz. Pop. 2000. There is an interesting church, a
  basilica, dating from the beginning of the 13th century. There are also
  ruins of a Gothic church of the 13th and 15th centuries. The ruined
  castle of Stahleck, crowning the heights above the town, is celebrated in
  history as the scene of the marriage between Henry, eldest son of Henry
  the Lion (shortly before the latter's death in 1195) and Agnes of
  Hohenstaufen, which effected a temporary reconciliation between the
  houses of Welf and Hohenstaufen. Other ruined castles are those of
  Fürstenberg and Stahlberg. All three belonged to the counts palatine. The
  wines of Bacharach were once held in the greatest esteem, and it is still
  one of the chief markets of the Rhenish wine trade.</p>

  <p><b>BACHAUMONT, LOUIS PETIT DE</b> (1690-1771), French littérateur, was
  of noble family and was brought up at the court of Versailles. He passed
  his whole life in Paris as the centre of the <i>salon</i> of Madame
  Doublet de Persan (1677-1771), where criticism of art and literature took
  the form of malicious gossip. A sort of register of news was kept in a
  journal of the <i>salon</i>, which dealt largely in scandals and
  contained accounts of books suppressed by the censor. Bachaumont's name
  is commonly connected with the first volumes of this register, which was
  published anonymously under the title <i>Mémoires secrets pour servir à
  l'histoire de la République des Lettres</i>, but his exact share in the
  authorship is a matter of controversy. It was continued by Pidansat de
  Mairobert (1707-1779) and others, until it reached 36 volumes
  (1774-1779). It is of some value as a historical source, especially for
  prohibited literature. Extracts were published by P. Lacroix in one
  volume, 1859. An incomplete edition (4 vols.) was undertaken in 1830 by
  Ravenal.</p>

  <i>Correspondance littéraire</i> of Grimm, Diderot, d'Alembert and others

  XVIII<sup><i>e</i></sup> siècle</i> (Paris, 1872).</p>

  <p><b>BACHE, ALEXANDER DALLAS</b> (1806-1867), American physicist,
  great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, was born at Philadelphia on the 19th
  of July 1806. After graduating at the United States Military Academy at
  West Point in 1825, he acted as assistant professor there for some time,
  and as a lieutenant in the corps of engineers he was engaged for a year
  or two in the erection of coast fortifications. He occupied the post of
  professor of natural philosophy and chemistry in the University of
  Pennsylvania in 1828-1841 and in 1842-1843. For the trustees of what in
  1848 was to become Girard College, but had not yet been opened, he spent
  the years 1836-1838 in Europe, examining European systems of education,
  and on his return published a very valuable report. In 1843, on the death
  of Professor F.&nbsp;R. Hassler (1770-1843), he was appointed <!-- Page 132
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[v.03
  p.0132]</span>superintendent of the United States coast survey. He
  succeeded in impressing Congress with a sense of the great value of this
  work, and by means of the liberal aid it granted, he carried out a
  singularly comprehensive plan with great ability and most satisfactory
  results. By a skilful division of labour, and by the erection of numerous
  observing stations, the mapping out of the whole coast proceeded
  simultaneously under the eye of the general director, and in addition a
  vast mass of magnetic and meteorological observations was collected. He
  died at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 17th of February 1867.</p>

  <p><b>BACHE, FRANCIS EDWARD</b> (1833-<span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `1888'.">1858</span>), English musical composer,
  was born in Birmingham on the 14th of September 1833. The pupil of Alfred
  Mellon for violin and Sterndale Bennett for composition, he afterwards
  went to Leipzig in 1853 and studied with Hauptmann and Plaidy.
  Considering the early age at which he died, his compositions are fairly
  numerous, and the best, a trio for piano and strings, is still held in
  high esteem. Two operettas, a piano concerto and a number of published
  pianoforte pieces and songs do little more than show how great was his
  promise. He died at Birmingham of consumption on the 24th of August 1858.
  His younger brother, <span class="sc">Walter Bache</span> (1842-1888),
  was born in Birmingham on the 19th of June 1842, and followed him to the
  Leipzig Conservatorium, where he became an excellent pianist. From 1862
  to 1865 he studied with Liszt in Rome, and for many years devoted himself
  to the task of winning popularity for his master's works in England. At
  his annual concerts in London nearly all Liszt's larger works were heard
  for the first time in England, and on the occasion of Liszt's last visit
  to England in 1886, he was entertained by Bache at a memorable reception
  at the Grosvenor Gallery. Walter Bache was professor of the pianoforte at
  the Royal Academy of Music for some years before his death, and the
  foundation of the Liszt scholarship at that institution was mainly due to
  his efforts. He died in London on the 26th of March 1888.</p>

  <p>An interesting memoir of the two brothers, by Miss Constance Bache,
  appeared in 1901 under the title <i>Brother Musicians</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BACHELOR</b> (from Med. Lat. <i>baccalarius</i>, with its late and
  rare variant <i>baccalaris</i>&mdash;cf. Ital.
  <i>baccalare</i>&mdash;through O. Fr. <i>bacheler</i>), in the most
  general sense of the word, a young man. The word, however, as it
  possesses several widely distinct applications, has passed through many
  meanings, and its ultimate origin is still involved in a certain amount
  of obscurity. The derivation from Welsh <i>bach</i>, little, is mentioned
  as "possible" by Skeat (<i>Etymological Dictionary</i>), but is
  "definitely discarded" by the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, and that
  given here is suggested as probable. The word <i>baccalarius</i> was
  applied to the tenant of a <i>baccalaria</i> (from <i>baccalia</i>, a
  herd of cows, <i>bacca</i> being a Low Latin variant of <i>vacca</i>),
  which was presumably at first a grazing farm and was practically the same
  as a <i>vaselleria</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the fief of a sub-vassal. Just,
  however, as the character and the size of the <i>baccalaria</i> varied in
  different ages, so the word <i>baccalarius</i> changed its significance;
  thus in the 8th century it was applied to the <i>rustici</i>, whether men
  or women (<i>baccalariae</i>), who worked for the tenant of a
  <i>mansus</i>. Throughout all its meanings the word has retained the idea
  of subordination suggested in this origin. Thus it came to be applied to
  various categories of persons as follows.&mdash;(1) Ecclesiastics of an
  inferior grade, <i>e.g.</i> young monks or even recently appointed canons
  (Severtius, <i>de episcopis Lugdunensibus</i>, p. 377, in du Cange). (2)
  Those belonging to the lowest stage of knighthood. Knights bachelors were
  either poor vassals who could not afford to take the field under their
  own banner, or knights too young to support the responsibility and
  dignity of knights bannerets (see <span class="sc">Knighthood and
  Chivalry</span>). (3) Those holding the preliminary degree of a
  university, enabling them to proceed to that of master (<i>magister</i>)
  which alone entitled them to teach. In this sense the word
  <i>baccalarius</i> or <i>baccalaureus</i> first appears at the university
  of Paris in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under
  the auspices of Pope Gregory IX., as applied to scholars still <i>in
  statu pupillari</i>. Thus there were two classes of <i>baccalarii</i>:
  the <i>baccalarii cursores</i>, <i>i.e.</i> theological candidates passed
  for admission to the divinity course, and the <i>baccalarii
  dispositi</i>, who, having completed this course, were entitled to
  proceed to the higher degrees. In modern universities the significance of
  the degree of bachelor, in relation to the others, varies; <i>e.g.</i> at
  Oxford and Cambridge the bachelor can proceed to his mastership by simply
  retaining his name on the books and paying certain fees; at other
  universities a further examination is still necessary. But in no case is
  the bachelor a full member of the university. The degree of bachelor (of
  arts, &amp;c.) is borne by women also. (4) The younger or inferior
  members of a trade gild or city company, otherwise known as "yeomen" (now
  obsolete). (5) Unmarried men, since these presumably have their fortunes
  yet to make and are not full citizens. The word bachelor, now confined to
  men in this connotation, was formerly sometimes used of women also.</p>

  <p>Bachelors, in the sense of unmarried men, have in many countries been
  subjected to penal laws. At Sparta, citizens who remained unmarried after
  a certain age suffered various penalties. They were not allowed to
  witness the gymnastic exercises of the maidens; and during winter they
  were compelled to march naked round the market-place, singing a song
  composed against themselves and expressing the justice of their
  punishment. The usual respect of the young to the old was not paid to
  bachelors (Plut. <i>Lyc.</i> 15). At Athens there was no definite
  legislation on this matter; but certain minor laws are evidently dictated
  by a spirit akin to the Spartan doctrine (see Schömann, <i>Gr.
  Alterth.</i> i. 548). At Rome, though there appear traces of some earlier
  legislation in the matter, the first clearly known law is that called the
  Lex Julia, passed about 18 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> It does not
  appear to have ever come into full operation; and in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 9 it was incorporated with the Lex Papia et
  Poppaea, the two laws being frequently cited as one, Lex Julia et Papia
  Poppaea. This law, while restricting marriages between the several
  classes of the people, laid heavy penalties on unmarried persons, gave
  certain privileges to those citizens who had several children, and
  finally imposed lighter penalties on married persons who were childless.
  Isolated instances of such penalties occur during the middle ages,
  <i>e.g.</i> by a charter of liberties granted by Matilda I., countess of
  Nevers, to Auxerre in 1223, an annual tax of five <i>solidi</i> is
  imposed on any man <i>qui non habet uxorem et est bachelarius</i>. In
  Britain there has been no direct legislation bearing on bachelors; but,
  occasionally, taxes have been made to bear more heavily on them than on
  others. Instances of this are the act (6 and 7 Will. III.) passed in
  1695; the tax on servants, 1785; and the income tax, 1798.</p>

  <p><b>BACHIAN</b> (Dutch <i>Batjan</i>), one of the Molucca Islands, in
  the residency of Ternate, Dutch East Indies, in the Molucca Sea, in
  0°13&prime;-0°55&prime; S. and 127°22&prime;-128° E. With its subordinate
  islands, Mandioli, Tawali and others, it lies west of the southern
  peninsula of the island of Halmahera or Jilolo, and has an area of 914
  sq. m. It is of irregular form, consisting of two distinct mountainous
  parts, united by a low isthmus, which a slight subsidence would submerge.
  The island is in part of volcanic formation, and the existence of hot
  springs points to volcanic activity. There are, however, especially in
  the southern portion, ancient and non-volcanic rocks. The highest
  elevation occurs at the south of the island, the mountain of Labua
  reaching 6950 ft. Coal and other minerals have been discovered. A large
  portion of the island is richly wooded, and sago, cocoa-nuts and cloves
  (which are indigenous) are abundantly produced. Bachian is remarkable as
  the most eastern point on the globe inhabited by any of the
  <i>Quadrumana</i>, a black ape occurring here as in Celebes. The island
  is very rich in birds and insects. The interior of the island is
  uninhabited and none of the dwellers on the coast are indigenous. They
  consist of the Sirani or Christian descendants of the Portuguese, of
  Malays, with a Papuan element, Galela men from the north of Halmahera,
  immigrants from Celebes, with some Chinese and Arabs. The total number of
  inhabitants is about 13,000. The chief village, called Amasing by the
  inhabitants, but also called Bachian, is situated on the west side of the
  isthmus. Bachian is the most important island of a group formerly
  governed by a sultan, but since 1889 by a committee of chiefs under the
  control of a Dutch <i>contrôleur</i>. From 1882 onwards a Batjan company
  attempted to exploit the island, but <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[v.03 p.0133]</span>unsuccessfully,
  owing to a deficient knowledge of the soil and its capabilities and a
  lack of labourers.</p>

  <p><b>BACK-BOND,</b> or <span class="sc">Back-Letter</span>, in Scots
  law, a deed qualifying the terms of another deed, or declaratory of the
  purposes for which another deed has been granted. Thus an <i>ex facie</i>
  absolute disposition, qualified by a back-bond expressing the limited
  nature of the right actually held by the person to whom the disposition
  is made, would constitute what in England is termed a deed of trust.</p>

  <p><b>BACK-CHOIR,</b> <span class="sc">Retro-Choir</span>, a space behind

  <p><b>BACKERGUNJE,</b> or <span class="sc">Bakarganj</span>, a district
  of British India in the Dacca division of Eastern Bengal and Assam. It
  forms part of the joint delta of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and its
  area is 4542 sq. m. The general aspect of the district is that of a flat
  even country, dotted with clusters of bamboos and betel-nut trees, and
  intersected by a perfect network of dark-coloured and sluggish streams.
  There is not a hill or hillock in the whole district, but it derives a
  certain picturesque beauty from its wide expanses of cultivation, and the
  greenness and freshness of the vegetation. This is especially conspicuous
  in the rains, but at no time of the year does the district present a
  dried or burnt-up appearance. The villages, which are always walled round
  by groves of bamboos and betel-nut palms, have often a very striking
  appearance; and Backergunje has many beauties of detail which strike a
  traveller in passing through the country. The level of the country is
  low, forming as it does a part of the great Gangetic delta; and the
  rivers, streams and water-courses are so numerous that it is very
  difficult to travel except by boat at any season of the year. Every
  natural hollow is full of water, around the margin of which long grasses,
  reeds and other aquatic plants grow in the greatest profusion, often
  making it difficult to say where the land ends and the water begins.
  Towards the north-west the country is very marshy and nothing is to be
  seen for miles but tracts of unreclaimed swamps and rice lands, with a
  few huts scattered here and there and raised on mounds of earth. In the
  south of the district, along the coast of the Bay of Bengal, lie the
  forest tracts of the Sundarbans, the habitation of tigers, leopards and
  other wild beasts.</p>

  <p>The principal rivers of the district are the Meghna, the Arial Khan
  and the Haringhata or Baleswar, with their numerous offshoots. The Meghna
  represents the accumulated waters of the Brahmaputra and Ganges. It flows
  along the eastern boundary of the district in a southerly direction for
  about 100 m. till it debouches into the Bay of Bengal. During the latter
  part of its course this noble river expands into a large estuary
  containing many islands, the principal of which is that of Dakshin
  Shahbazpur. The islands on the sea-front are exposed to devastation by
  cyclonic storm-waves. The Arial Khan, a branch of the Ganges, enters the
  district from the north, and flows generally in a south-easterly
  direction till it falls into the estuary of the Meghna. The main channel
  of the Arial Khan is about 1700 yds. in width in the dry season, and from
  2000 to 3000 yds. in the rains. It receives a number of tributaries,
  sends off several offshoots, and is navigable throughout the year by
  native cargo boats of the largest size. The Haringhata, Baleswar,
  Madhumati and Garai are various local names for the same river in
  different parts of its course and represent another great offshoot of the
  Ganges. It enters Backergunje near the north-west corner of the district,
  whence it forms its western boundary, and runs south, but with great
  windings in its upper reaches, till it crosses the Sundarbans, and
  finally falls into the Bay of Bengal by a large and deep estuary, capable
  of receiving ships of considerable burden. In the whole of its course
  through the district the river is navigable by native boats of large
  tonnage, and by large sea-going ships as high up as Morrellganj, in the
  neighbouring district of Jessore. Among its many tributaries in
  Backergunje the most important is the Kacha, itself a considerable stream
  and navigable by large boats all the year round, which flows in a
  southerly direction for 20 m., when it falls into the Baleswar. Other
  rivers of minor importance are the Barisal, Bishkhali, Nihalganj,
  Khairabad, Ghagar, Kumar, &amp;c. All the rivers in the district are
  subject to tidal action from the Meghna on the north, and from the Bay of
  Bengal on the south, and nearly all of them are navigable at high tide by
  country boats of all sizes. The rise of the tide is very considerable in
  the estuary of the Meghna, and many of the creeks and water-courses in
  the island of Dakshin Shahbazpur, which are almost dry at ebb tide,
  contain 18 or 19 ft. of water at the flood. A very strong "bore" or tidal
  wave runs up the estuary of the Meghna at spring tides, and a singular
  sound like thunder, known as the "Barisal guns," is often heard far out
  at sea about the time it is coming in. There are numerous marshes in the
  district, of great size and depth, and abounding in fish.</p>

  <p>The Mussulmans of Backergunje are among the worst of their creed,
  steeped in ignorance and prejudice, easily excited to violence and
  murder, very litigious and grossly immoral. On account of an epidemic of
  murders disarmament had to be enforced in the district. The Faraizis or
  Puritan sect of Mahommedans are exceedingly numerous in the district. The
  Buddhist population consists of Maghs or the people of Arakan, who first
  settled in Backergunje about 1800, and have made themselves very useful
  in the clearing of the Sundarbans. A gipsy-like tribe called the Bebajias
  are rather numerous in this district. They live principally in boats,
  travelling from place to place, profess Mahommedanism, and gain their
  subsistence by wood-cutting in the Sundarbans, fishing, fortune-telling
  and trading in trinkets. In 1901 the population was 2,291,752, showing an
  increase of 6% in the decade.</p>

  <p>A number of small trading villages exist throughout the district, and
  each locality has its periodical fairs for purposes of traffic. The
  material condition of the people is good. Every inhabitant is a small
  landholder and cultivates sufficient rice and other necessaries for the
  support of his family. Owing to this reason, hired labour is very scarce.
  Rice is the great crop of the district, and three harvests are obtained
  annually&mdash;the <i>aman</i>, or winter rice; <i>aus</i>, or autumn
  crop; and <i>boro</i>, or spring rice. The climate of Backergunje is one
  of the healthiest in Eastern Bengal, owing to the strong south-west
  monsoon, which comes up directly from the Bay of Bengal, and keeps the
  atmosphere cool; but the heavy rainfall and consequent humidity of the
  atmosphere, combined with the use of bad water, are fruitful sources of
  disease. The average annual temperature varies from 78° to 85° F. The
  thermometer ranges from 62° to 98°.</p>

  <p>Barisal, the headquarters station, situated on the west bank of the
  Barisal river, had a population in 1901 of 18,978. The next largest town
  is Pirojpur (14,119).</p>

  <p><b>BACKGAMMON,</b> a game played with draughtsmen and a special board,
  depending on the throw of dice. It is said to have been invented about
  the 10th century (Strutt). A similar game (<i>Ludus duodecim
  scriptorum</i>, the "twelve-line game") was known to the Romans, and
  Plato (<i>Republic</i>, bk. x.) alludes to a game in which dice were
  thrown and men were placed after due consideration. The etymology of the
  word "backgammon" is disputed; it is probably Saxon&mdash;<i>baec</i>,
  back, <i>gamen</i>, game; <i>i.e.</i> a game in which the players are
  liable to be sent back. Other derivations are, Dan. <i>bakke</i>, tray,
  <i>gammen</i>, game (Wedgwood); and Welsh <i>bach</i>, little,
  <i>cammaun</i>, battle (Henry). Chaucer alludes to a game of "tables,"
  played with three dice, in which "men" were moved from the opponent's
  "tables," the game (<i>ludus Anglicorum</i>) being described in the
  Harleian MSS. (1527). The French name for backgammon is <i>trictrac</i>,
  imitative of the rattle of the dice.</p>

  <p>Backgammon is played by two persons. The "board" (see diagram) is
  divided into four "tables," each table being marked with six "points"
  coloured differently. The inner and outer tables are separated from each
  other by a projecting <i>bar</i>. The board (in the ordinary form of the
  game) is furnished with fifteen white and fifteen black men, "set" or
  arranged as in the diagram. It is usual to make the inner table the one
  nearest to the light. Two dice-boxes are required, one for each player,
  and a pair of dice, which are used by both players. The dice are marked
  with numbers on their six sides, from one to six, number one being
  called, "ace"; two, "deuce": three, "trey." Formerly the <!-- Page 134
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[v.03 p.0134]</span>four
  was called "quatre" (pronounced "cater"); the five, "cinque" (pronounced
  either "sank" or "sink"); and the six, "six" (size).</p>

  <p>For the right to start each player throws one or two dice; the one who
  throws the higher number has the right of playing first; and he may
  either adopt the numbers thrown or he may throw again, using both
  dice.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/backgammon_1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/backgammon_1.png"
      alt="Backgammon board." title="Backgammon board." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The men are moved on from point to point, according to the throws of
  the dice made by the players alternately. White moves from black's inner
  table to black's outer, and from this to white's outer table, and so on
  to white's inner table; and all black's moves must be in the contrary
  direction. A player may move any of his men a number of points
  corresponding to the numbers thrown by him, provided the point to which
  the move would bring him is not <i>blocked</i> by two or more of his
  adversary's men being on it. The whole throw may be taken with one man,
  or two men maybe moved, one the exact number of points on one die, the
  other the number on the other die. If doublets are thrown (<i>e.g.</i>
  two sixes), four moves of that number (<i>e.g.</i> four moves of six
  points) may be made, either all by one man or separately by more. Thus,
  suppose white throws five, six, he may move one of his men from the
  left-hand corner of the black's inner table to the left-hand corner of
  black's outer table for six; he may, again, move the same man five points
  farther on, when his move is completed; or he may move any other man five
  points. But white cannot move a man for five from the black's ace-point,
  because the six-point in that table is blocked. Any part of the throw
  which cannot be moved is of no effect, but it is compulsory for a player
  to move the whole throw unless blocked. Thus if the men were differently
  placed, and white could move a six, and having done so could not move a
  five, his move is completed. If, however, by moving the five first, he
  can afterwards move a six, he must make the move in that manner.</p>

  <p>When a player so moves as to place two men on the same point, he is
  said to "make a point."</p>

  <p>When there is only a single man on a point, it is called a "blot."
  When a blot is left, the man there may be taken up (technically the blot
  may be "hit") by the adversary if he throws a number which will enable
  him to place a man on that point. The man hit is placed on the bar, and
  has to begin again by entering the adversary's home table again at the
  next throw should it result in a number that corresponds to an unblocked
  point. The points in the home tables count for this purpose as 1, 2, 3,
  4, 5, 6, beginning from the ace-point. A player is not allowed to move
  any other man while he has one to enter. It is, therefore, an advantage
  to have made all the points in your own board, so that your adversary, if
  you take a man up, cannot enter; and you can then continue throwing until
  a point is opened.</p>

  <p>The game proceeds until one of the players gets all his men into his
  inner table or <i>home</i>. Then he begins to take his men off the board,
  or to <i>bear</i> them, <i>i.e.</i> to remove a man from any point that
  corresponds in number with his throw. If such a point is unoccupied, a
  move must be made, if there is room for it, and a move may be taken,
  instead of bearing a man, at any time; but when six is empty, if six is
  thrown a man may be borne from five and so on. If, after a player has
  commenced throwing off his men, he should be hit on a blot, he must enter
  on his adversary's inner table and must bring the man taken up into his
  own inner table before he can bear further.</p>

  <p>Whoever first takes off all his men wins the game:&mdash;a single game
  (a "hit") if his adversary has begun bearing; a double game (a "gammon")
  if the adversary has not borne a man; and a triple game (a "backgammon")
  if, at the time the winner bears his last man, his adversary, not having
  borne a man, has one in the winner's inner table, or has a man up. When a
  series of games is played, the winner of a hit has the first throw in the
  succeeding game; but if a gammon is won, the players each throw a single
  die to determine the first move of the next game.</p>

  <p>In order to play backgammon well, it is necessary to know all the
  chances on two dice and to apply them in various ways. The number of
  different throws that can be made is thirty-six. By taking all the
  combinations of these throws which include given numbers, it is easily
  discovered where blots may be left with the least probability of being
  hit. For example, to find the chance of being hit where a blot can only
  be taken up by an ace, the adversary may throw two aces, or ace in
  combination with any other number up to six, and he may throw each of
  these in two different ways, so that there are in all eleven ways in
  which an ace may be thrown. This, deducted from thirty-six (the total
  number of throws), leaves twenty-five; so that it is 25 to 11 against
  being hit on an ace. It is very important to bear in mind the chance of
  being hit on any number. The following table gives the odds against being
  hit on any number within the reach of one or two dice: -</p>

  <p>The table shows that if a blot must be left within the reach of one
  die, the nearer it is left to the adversary's man the less probability
  there is of its being hit. Also, that it is long odds against being hit
  on a blot which is only to be reached with double dice, and that, in that
  case (on any number from 7 to 11), the farther off the blot is, the less
  chance there is of its being hit.</p>

  <p>The table assumes that the board is open for every possible throw. If
  part of the throw is blocked by an intervening point being held by
  adverse men, the chance of being hit is less.</p>

  <p>Two principles, then, have to be considered in moving the men:&mdash;
  (1) To make points where there is the best chance of obstructing the
  opponent. (2) When obliged to leave blots, to choose the position in
  which they are least likely to be hit.</p>

  <p>The best points to secure are the five-point in your own inner table
  and the five-point in your adversary's inner table. The next best is your
  own bar-point; and the next best the four in your own inner table.</p>

  <p>The best move for some throws at the commencement of a game is as
  follows:&mdash;Aces (the best of all throws), move two on your bar-point
  and two on your five-point. This throw is often given to inferior players
  by way of odds.</p>

  <p>Ace, trey: make the five-point in your inner table.</p>

  <p>Ace, six: make your bar-point.</p>

  <p>Deuces: move two on the four-point in your inner table, and two on the
  trey-point in your opponent's inner table.</p>

  <p>Deuce, four: make the four-point in your own table.</p>

  <p>Threes: play two on the five-point in your inner table, and two on the
  four-point of your adversary's inner table, or make your bar-point.</p>

  <p>Trey, five: make the trey-point in your own table.</p>

  <p>Trey, six: bring a man from your adversary's ace-point as far as he
  will go.</p>

  <p>Fours: move on two on the five-point in your adversary's inner table,
  and two from the five in his outer table.</p>

  <p>Four, five and four, six: carry a man from your adversary's ace-point
  as far as he will go.</p>

  <p>Fives: move two men from the five in your adversary's outer table to
  the trey-point in your inner table.</p>

  <p>Five, six: move a man from your adversary's ace-point as far as he
  will go.</p>

  <p>Sixes (the second-best throw): move two on your adversary's bar-point
  and two on your own bar-point.</p>

  <p>In carrying the men home carry the most distant man to your
  adversary's bar-point, to the six-point in your outer table, and then to
  the six-point in your inner table. By following this rule as nearly <!--
  Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[v.03
  p.0135]</span>as the throws admit, you will carry the men to your inner
  table in the fewest number of throws.</p>

  <p>Avoid carrying many men upon the trey or deuce-point in your own
  tables, as these men are out of play.</p>

  <p>Whenever you have taken up two of your adversary's men, and two or
  more points made in your inner table, spread your other men in the hope
  of making another point in your tables, and of hitting the man your
  adversary enters.</p>

  <p>Always take up a man if the blot you leave in making the move can only
  be hit with double dice, but if you already have two of your opponent's
  men in your tables it is unwise to take up a third.</p>

  <p>In entering a man which it is to your adversary's advantage to hit,
  leave the blot upon the lowest point you can, <i>e.g.</i> ace-point in
  preference to deuce-point.</p>

  <p>When your adversary is bearing his men, and you have two men in his
  table, say, on his ace-point, and several men in the outer table, it is
  to your advantage to leave one man on the ace-point, because it prevents
  his bearing his men to the greatest advantage, and gives you the chance
  of his leaving a blot. But if you find that you can probably save the
  gammon by bringing both your men out of his table, do not wait for a
  blot. Eight points is the average throw.</p>

  <p>The laws of backgammon (as given by Hoyle) are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. When a man is touched by the caster it must be played if possible;
  if impossible no penalty. 2. A man is not played till it is placed upon a
  point and quitted. 3. If a player omits a man from the board there is no
  penalty. 4. If he bears any number of men before he has entered a man
  taken up, men so borne must be entered again. 5. If he has mistaken his
  throw and played it, and his adversary has thrown, it is not in the
  choice of either of the players to alter it, unless they both agree to do
  so. 6. If one or both dice are "cocked," <i>i.e.</i> do not lie fairly
  and squarely on the table, a fresh throw is imperative.</p>

  <p><i>Russian Backgammon</i> varies from the above game in that the men,
  instead of being set as in the diagram, are entered in the same table by
  throws of the dice, and both players move in the same direction round to
  the opposite table. There are various rules for this game. By some a
  player is not obliged to enter all his men before he moves any; he can
  take up blots at any time on entering, but while he has a man up, he must
  enter it before entering any more or moving any of those already entered.
  If he cannot enter the man that is up, he loses the benefit of the
  throw.</p>

  <p>A player who throws doublets must play or enter not only the number
  thrown, but also doublets of the number corresponding to the opposite
  side of the dice; thus, if he throws sixes, he must first enter or move
  the sixes, as the case may be, and then aces, and he also has another
  throw. Some rules allow him to play either doublets first, but he must
  always complete one set before playing the other. If a player cannot play
  the whole of his throw, his adversary is sometimes allowed to play the
  unplayed portion, in which cases the caster is sometimes allowed to come
  in and complete his moves, if he can, and in the event of his having
  thrown deuce-ace or doublets to throw again. If he throws doublets a
  second time, he moves and throws again, and so on. The privilege is
  sometimes restricted by not allowing this advantage to the first doublets
  thrown by each player. It is sometimes extended by allowing the thrower
  of the deuce-ace to choose any doublets he likes on the opposite side of
  the dice, and to throw again. The restriction with regard to the first
  doublets thrown does not apply to deuce-ace, nor does throwing it remove
  the restriction with regard to first doublets. A player must first be
  able to complete the doublets thrown. If the player cannot move the whole
  throw he cannot take the corresponding doublets, and he is not allowed
  another throw if he cannot move all the points to which he is
  entitled.</p>

  <p><b>BACKHUYSEN,</b> or <span class="sc">Bakhuisen</span>, <b>LUDOLF</b>
  (1631-1708), Dutch painter, was born at Emden, in Hanover. He was brought
  up as a merchant at Amsterdam, but early discovered so strong a genius
  for painting that he relinquished business and devoted himself to art. He
  studied first under Allart van Everdingen and then under Hendrik Dubbels,
  two eminent masters of the time, and soon became celebrated for his
  sea-pieces. He was an ardent student of nature, and frequently exposed
  himself on the sea in an open boat in order to study the effects of
  tempests. His compositions, which are very numerous, are nearly all
  variations of one subject, and in a style peculiarly his own, marked by
  intense realism or faithful imitation of nature. In his later years
  Backhuysen employed his time in etching and calligraphy. He died in
  Amsterdam on the 17th of November 1708.</p>

  <p><b>BACKNANG,</b> a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Württemberg, 19
  m. by rail N.E. from Stuttgart. Pop. (1900) 7650. It has an interesting
  church, dating from the 12th century, and notable tanneries and leather
  factories, woollen and cloth mills. In 1325 Backnang was ceded to
  Württemberg by Baden. In the vicinity is the Wilhelmsheim sanatorium for
  consumptives.</p>

  <p><b>BACKSCRATCHER,</b> a long slender rod of wood, whalebone,
  tortoiseshell, horn or cane, with a carved human hand, usually of ivory,
  mounted at the extremity. Its name suggests the primary use of the
  implement, but little is known of its history, and it was unquestionably
  also employed as a kind of rake to keep in order the huge "heads" of
  powdered hair worn by ladies during a considerable portion of the 18th
  and the early part of the 19th centuries. The backscratcher varies in
  length from 12 to 20 in., and the more elaborate examples, which were
  occasionally hung from the waist, are silver-mounted, and in rare
  instances the ivory fingers bear carved rings. The hand is sometimes
  outstretched, and sometimes the fingers are flexed; the modelling is
  frequently good, the fingers delicately formed and the nails well
  defined. As a rule the rod is finished off with a knob. The hand was now
  and again replaced by a rake or a bird's claw. The hand was indifferently
  dexter or sinister, but the Chinese variety usually bears a right hand.
  Like most of the obsolete appliances of daily life, the backscratcher, or
  scratch-back, as it is sometimes called, has become scarce, and it is one
  of the innumerable objects which attract the attention of the modern
  collector.</p>

  flowing with a very tortuous course N.E. to an inlet of the Arctic Ocean,
  passing through several large lake-expansions&mdash;Pelly, Carry,

  1834. Its total length is 560 m.</p>

  <p><b>BACKWARDATION,</b> or, as it is more often called for brevity,
  <span class="sc">Back</span>, a technical term employed on the London
  Stock Exchange to express the amount charged for the loan of stock from
  one account to the other, and paid to the purchaser by the seller on a
  bear account (see <span class="sc">Account</span>) in order to allow the
  seller to defer the delivery of the stock. The seller, having sold for
  delivery on a certain date, stocks or shares which probably he does not
  possess, in the hope that he may be able, before the day fixed for
  delivery, to buy them at a cheaper price and so earn a profit, finds on
  settling-day that the prices have not gone down according to his
  expectation, and therefore pays the purchaser an agreed amount of
  interest (<i>backwardation</i>) for the privilege of deferring the
  delivery, either in order to procure the stock, or else in the hope that
  there will be a shrinkage in the price which will enable him to gain a
  profit. (See also <span class="sc">Stock Exchange</span>).</p>

  <p><b>BACON, FRANCIS</b> (<span class="sc">Baron Verulam, Viscount St
  Albans</span>) (1561-1626), English philosopher, statesman and essayist,
  was born at York House in the Strand, London, on the 22nd of January
  1560/1. He was the youngest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon (<i>q.v.</i>). His
  mother, the second wife of Sir Nicholas, was a daughter of Sir Anthony
  Cooke, formerly tutor to Edward VI. She was a woman of considerable
  culture, well skilled in the classical studies of the period, and a warm
  adherent of the Reformed or Puritan Church. Very little is known of
  Bacon's early life and education. His health being then, as always,
  extremely delicate, he probably received much of his instruction at home.
  In April 1573 he was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, where for
  three years he resided with his brother Anthony. At Cambridge he applied
  himself diligently to the several sciences as then taught, and came to
  the conclusion that the methods employed and the results attained were
  alike erroneous. Although he preserved a reverence for Aristotle (of
  whom, however, he seems to have known but little), he learned to despise
  the current Aristotelian philosophy. It yielded no fruit, was serviceable
  only for disputation, and the end it proposed to itself was a mistaken
  one. Philosophy must be taught its true purpose, and for this purpose a
  new method must be devised. With the <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[v.03 p.0136]</span>first germs of
  this great conception in his mind, Bacon left the university.</p>

  <p>On the 27th of June 1576 he and his brother Anthony were entered <i>de
  societate magistrorum</i> at Gray's Inn, and a few months later he was
  sent abroad with Sir Amyas Paulet, the English ambassador at Paris. The
  disturbed state of government and society in France at that time afforded
  him valuable political instruction. It was formerly supposed that certain
  <i>Notes on the State of Christendom</i>, usually printed in his works,
  contain the results of his observations, but Spedding has shown that
  there is no reason for ascribing these <i>Notes</i> to him, and that they
  may be attributed with more probability to one of his brother Anthony's
  correspondents.</p>

  <p>The sudden death of his father in February 1578/9 necessitated Bacon's
  return to England, and exercised a very serious influence on his
  fortunes. A considerable sum of money had been laid up by Sir Nicholas
  for the purchase of an estate for his youngest son, the only one
  otherwise unprovided for. Owing to his sudden death, this intention was
  not carried out, and a fifth only of the money descended to Francis. This
  was one of the gravest misfortunes of his life; he started with
  insufficient means, acquired a habit of borrowing and was never
  afterwards out of debt. As it had become necessary that he should adopt
  some profession, he selected that of law, and took up his residence at
  Gray's Inn in 1579.</p>

  <p>In the fragment <i>De Interpretation Naturae Prooemium</i> (written
  probably about 1603) Bacon analyses his own mental character and lays
  before us the objects he had in view when he entered on public life. If
  his opening sentence, "Ego cum me ad utilitates humanas natum
  existimarem" ("since I thought myself born to be of advantage to
  mankind"), seems at first sight a little arrogant, it must be remembered
  that it is the arrogance of Aristotle's <span title="megalopsuchos" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F79;&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,<a
  name="FnAnchor_131" href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[1]</sup></a> who thinks
  himself worthy of great things, and is worthy. The ideal of production of
  good to the human race through the discovery of truth, was combined in
  him with the practical desire to be of service to his country. He
  purposed, therefore, to obtain, if possible, some honourable post in the
  state which would give him the means of realizing these projects, and
  would enable him to do somewhat for the church, the third of the objects
  whose good he had at heart. The constant striving after these three ends
  is the key to Bacon's life. His qualifications for accomplishing the task
  were not small. His intellect was far-seeing and acute, quick and yet
  cautious, meditative, methodical and free from prejudice. If we add to
  this account that he seems to have been of an unusually amiable
  disposition we have a fairly complete picture of his mental character at
  this critical period of his life.</p>

  <p>In 1580 he appears to have taken the first step in his career by
  applying, through his uncle, Burghley, the lord treasurer, for some post
  at court. His suit, though well received by the queen, was unsuccessful;
  the particulars are totally unknown. For two years after this
  disappointment he worked quietly at Gray's Inn, and in 1582 was admitted
  an outer barrister. In 1584 he took his seat in parliament for Melcombe
  in Dorsetshire, but the notes for the session do not disclose what
  reputation he gained. About the same time he made another application to
  Burghley, apparently with a view to expediting his progress at the bar.
  His uncle, who appears to have "taken his zeal for ambition," wrote him a
  severe letter, taking him to task for arrogance and pride, qualities
  which Bacon vehemently disclaimed. As his advancement at the bar was
  unusually rapid, his uncle's influence may have been exerted in his
  behalf. In 1589 he received the first substantial piece of patronage from
  his powerful kinsman, the reversion of the clerkship of the Star Chamber.
  The office was worth about £1600 a year; but it did not become vacant for
  nearly twenty years. A considerable period of his life thus slipped away,
  and his affairs had not prospered. He had written on the condition of
  parties in the church; he had set down his thoughts on philosophical
  reform in the lost tract, <i>Temporis Partus Maximus</i>; but he had
  failed in obtaining the position which he looked upon as an indispensable
  condition of success. A long and eloquent letter to Burghley<a
  name="FnAnchor_132" href="#Footnote_132"><sup>[2]</sup></a> throws
  additional light upon his character, and gives a hint as to the cause of
  his uncle's slackness in promoting him.</p>

  <p>Some time before this, perhaps as early as 1588, Bacon appears to have
  become acquainted with the earl of Essex, Elizabeth's favourite. At the
  close of 1591 he was acting as the earl's confidential adviser, and
  exerted himself, together with his brother Anthony, diligently in the
  earl's service. In February 1593 parliament was called, and Bacon took
  his seat for Middlesex. The special occasion for which the House had been
  summoned was the discovery of one of the numerous popish plots that
  distracted Elizabeth's reign.</p>

  <p>As Bacon's conduct in this emergency seriously affected his fortunes
  and has been much misunderstood, it is necessary to state, as briefly as
  possible, the whole facts of the case. The House having been duly
  informed of the state necessities, assented to a double subsidy and
  appointed a committee to draw up the requisite articles. Before this was
  completed, a message arrived from the House of Lords requesting a
  conference, which was granted. The committee of the Commons were then
  informed that the crisis demanded a triple subsidy to be collected in a
  shorter time than usual, that the Lords could not assent to less than
  this, and that they desired to confer on the matter. This proposal of the
  Lords to discuss supply infringed upon the privileges of the Commons;
  accordingly, when the report of committee was read to the Lower House,
  Bacon spoke against the proposed conference, pointing out at the same
  time that a communication from the Lords might be received, but that the
  actual deliberation on it must be taken by themselves alone. His motion,
  after some delay, was carried and the conference was rejected. The Lords
  upon this lowered their demands, and desired merely to make a
  communication, which, being legitimate, was at once assented to. The
  House had then before them the proposal for a triple subsidy, to be
  collected in three, or, as the motion ultimately was shaped, in four
  years, instead of in six, as the ordinary custom would have been. Bacon,
  who approved of the increased subsidy, was opposed to the short period in
  which it was proposed to raise it. He suggested that it would be
  difficult or impossible for the people to meet such heavy demands, that
  discontent and trouble would arise, and that the better method of
  procedure was to raise money by levy or imposition. His motion appears to
  have received no support, and the four years' subsidy was passed
  unanimously. Bacon, as it turned out, had been mistaken in thinking that
  the country would be unable to meet the increased taxation, and his
  conduct, though prompted by a pure desire to be of service to the queen,
  gave deep and well-nigh ineradicable offence. He was accused <!-- Page
  137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[v.03 p.0137]</span>of
  seeking popularity, and was for a time excluded from the court. His
  letter to Burghley,<a name="FnAnchor_133"
  href="#Footnote_133"><sup>[3]</sup></a> who had told him of the queen's
  displeasure with his speech, offers no apology for what he had said, but
  expresses regret that his motives should have been misunderstood. He soon
  felt that the queen's anger was not to be appeased by such a
  justification. The attorney-generalship had fallen vacant and Bacon
  became a candidate for the office, his most formidable rival being his
  life-long antagonist, Edward Coke, who was then solicitor. Essex warmly
  espoused Bacon's cause and earnestly pressed his claims upon the queen;
  but his impetuous, pettish pleading tended to retard the cause. Burghley,
  on the other hand, in no way promoted his nephew's interest; he would
  recommend him for the solicitorship, but not for the
  attorney-generalship; and it is not improbable that Sir Robert Cecil
  secretly used his influence against his cousin. The queen delayed the
  appointment, and Bacon's fortunes, as they then stood, could ill brook
  delay. He was harassed with debt and at times so disheartened that he
  contemplated retirement from public life. In March 1594 it was at last
  understood that Coke was to be attorney-general. Essex, though bitterly
  mortified, at once threw all his energies into the endeavour to procure
  for Bacon the solicitorship; but in this case also, his method of
  dealing, which was wholly opposed to Bacon's advice,<a
  name="FnAnchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"><sup>[4]</sup></a> seemed to
  irritate the queen. The old offence was not yet forgiven, and after a
  tedious delay, the office was given, in October 1595, to Serjeant Thomas
  Fleming. Burghley and Sir John Puckering seem to have assisted Bacon
  honestly, if not over-warmly, in this second application; but the conduct
  of Cecil had roused suspicions which were not perhaps without foundation.
  Essex, to compensate in some degree for Bacon's disappointment, insisted
  on presenting him with a piece of land, worth about £1800, and situated
  probably near Twickenham Park. Nor did his kindness cease there; before
  sailing on the expedition to Cadiz, in the beginning of 1596, he
  addressed letters to Buckhurst, Fortescue and Egerton, earnestly
  requesting them to use their influence towards procuring for Bacon the
  vacant office of master of the rolls. Before anything came of this
  application, the Cadiz expedition had resulted in a brilliant success,
  and Essex became the idol of the army and the people. Bacon saw clearly
  that such a reputation would assuredly alienate the affections of the
  queen, who loved not to have a subject too powerful or too popular. He
  therefore addressed an eloquent and imploring letter to the earl,
  pointing out the dangers of his position and urging upon him what he
  judged to be the only safe course of action, to seek and secure the
  favour of the queen alone; above all things dissuading him from the
  appearance of military popularity. His advice, however, was unpalatable
  and proved ineffectual. The earl still continued his usual course of
  dealing with the queen, depending solely upon her supposed affection for
  him, and insanely jealous of any other whom she might seem to favour. His
  unskilful and unlucky management of the sea expedition to Ferrol and the
  Azores in no way lowered his popularity with the people, but undoubtedly
  weakened his influence with the queen.</p>

  <p>Bacon's affairs in the meantime had not been prospering. He had
  increased his reputation by the publication in 1597 of his <i>Essays</i>,
  along with which were the <i>Colours of Good and Evil</i> and the
  <i>Meditationes Sacrae</i>; but his private fortunes were in a bad
  condition. No public office apparently could be found for him; a scheme
  for retrieving his position by a marriage with the wealthy widow, Lady
  Elizabeth Hatton, failed, and in 1598 he was arrested for debt. He seems,
  however, to have been growing in favour with the queen. Some years
  previously (perhaps about 1594), he had begun to be employed by her in
  crown affairs, and he gradually acquired the standing of one of the
  learned counsel, though he had no commission or warrant, and received no
  salary. At the same time he was no longer on the former friendly terms
  with Essex, a certain estrangement having sprung up between them, caused
  no doubt by the earl's dislike of his friend's advice. The earl's affairs
  were then at a somewhat critical stage, and as our judgment upon a most
  important episode in Bacon's life depends upon our knowledge of the
  events of the ensuing year, it will be requisite to enter somewhat
  minutely into proceedings with which Bacon himself had nothing to do.</p>

  <p>Ireland was then in a rebellious and discontented condition, and it
  was difficult for the English government to decide either on a definite
  course of policy with regard to it, or on a leader by whom that policy
  might be carried out. A violent quarrel took place between the queen and
  Essex, who for some months retired from court and refused to be
  reconciled. At last he came forth from his seclusion, and it was soon
  understood that he was in person to undertake the subjugation of the
  rebels in Ireland, with a larger force than had ever before been sent
  into that country. Into the obscure details of this unhappy campaign it
  is unnecessary to enter; one fact stands out clearly, that Essex
  endeavoured to carry out a treasonable design. His jealousy and
  ill-temper had been so roused that the only course open to him seemed to
  be the obtaining a powerful military force, the possession of which would
  compel the queen to reinstate him in her favour. Whether or not this plan
  was in contemplation before he undertook the Irish expedition is not
  evident, though even outsiders at that time entertained some suspicions,
  but there can be no doubt of the treasonable character of the
  negotiations carried on in Ireland. His plans, probably not very
  definite, were disturbed by an imperative message from the queen,
  ordering him not to return to England without her permission. He at once
  set off, and, trusting apparently to her affection for him, presented
  himself suddenly before her. He was, for the moment, received kindly, but
  was soon afterwards ordered to keep his chamber, and was then given into
  the custody of the lord keeper at York House, where he remained till
  March 1600. His great popularity, and the general ignorance of the
  reasons for his imprisonment, stirred up a strong feeling against the
  queen, who was reported to be influenced by Bacon, and such indignation
  was raised against the latter that his friends feared his life would be
  in danger. It was at last felt necessary that the queen should in some
  way vindicate her proceedings, and this she at first did, contrary to
  Bacon's advice, by a declaration from the Star Chamber. This, however,
  gave little or no satisfaction, and it was found expedient to do what
  Bacon had always recommended, to have a fair trial, yet not one in which
  the sentence must needs be damaging to the earl. The trial accordingly
  took place before a body of her majesty's councillors, and Bacon had a
  subordinate and unimportant part in the accusation. Essex does not seem
  to have been at all hurt by his action in this matter, and shortly after
  his release they were again on friendly terms, Bacon drawing up letters
  as if to or from the earl with the design of having them brought before
  the queen. But Bacon did not know the true character of the transactions
  in which Essex had been engaged. The latter had been released from all
  custody in August, but in the meantime he had been busily engaged in
  treasonable correspondence with James of Scotland, and was counting on
  the Irish army under his ally, Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy (afterwards
  earl of Devonshire), the new deputy. But Mountjoy had apparently come to
  see how useless the attempt would be to force upon the queen a settlement
  of the succession and declined to go farther in the matter. Essex was
  thus thrown upon his own resources, and his anger against the queen being
  roused afresh by the refusal to renew his monopoly of sweet wines, he
  formed the desperate project of seizing her person and compelling her to
  dismiss from her council his enemies Raleigh, Cobham, and Cecil. As some
  pretext, he intended to affirm that his life was in danger from these
  men, who were in league with the Spaniards. The plot was forced on
  prematurely by the suspicions excited at court, and the rash attempt to
  rouse the city of London (8th of February 1601), proved a complete
  <i>fiasco</i>. The leaders were arrested that night and thrown into
  prison. Although the actual rising might have appeared a mere outburst of
  frantic passion, the private examinations of the most prominent <!-- Page
  138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[v.03
  p.0138]</span>conspirators disclosed to the government a plot so widely
  spread, and involving so many of the highest in the land, that it would
  have been perilous to have pressed home accusations against all who might
  be implicated. Essex was tried along with the young earl of Southampton,
  and Bacon, as one of her majesty's counsel, was present on the occasion.
  Coke, who was principal spokesman, managed the case with great want of
  skill, incessantly allowing the thread of the evidence to escape, and
  giving the prisoners opportunity to indulge in irrelevant justifications
  and protestations which were not ineffectual in distracting attention
  from the real question at issue. On the first opportunity Bacon rose and
  briefly pointed out that the earl's plea of having done nothing save what
  was absolutely necessary to defend his life from the machinations of his
  enemies was weak and worthless, inasmuch as these enemies were purely
  imaginary; and he compared his case to that of Peisistratus, who had made
  use of a somewhat similar stratagem to cloak his real designs upon the
  city of Athens. He was thereupon interrupted by the earl, who proceeded
  to defend himself, by declaring that in one of the letters drawn up by
  Bacon, and purporting to be from the earl to Anthony Bacon, the existence
  of these rumours, and the dangers to be apprehended from them, had been
  admitted; and he continued, "If these reasons were then just and true,
  not counterfeit, how can it be that now my pretences are false and
  injurious?" To this Bacon replied, that "the letters, if they were there,
  would not blush to be seen for anything contained in them, and that he
  had spent more time in vain in studying how to make the earl a good
  servant to the queen than he had done in any thing else." It seems to be
  forgotten in the general accounts of this matter, not only that Bacon's
  letters bear out what he said, but that the earl's excuses were false. A
  second time Bacon was compelled to interfere in the course of the trial,
  and to recall to the minds of those present the real question at issue.
  He animadverted strongly upon the puerile nature of the defence, and in
  answer to a remark by Essex, that if he had wished to stir up a rebellion
  he would have had a larger company with him, pointed out that his
  dependence was upon the people of London, and compared his attempt to
  that of the duke of Guise at Paris. To this the earl made little or no
  reply. Bacon's use of this illustration and of the former one of
  Peisistratus, has been much commented on, and in general it seems to have
  been thought that had it not been for his speeches Essex might have
  escaped, or, at all events, have been afterwards pardoned. But this view
  of the matter depends on the supposition that Essex was guilty only of a
  rash outbreak.<a name="FnAnchor_135"
  href="#Footnote_135"><sup>[5]</sup></a> That this was not the case was
  well known to the queen and her council. Unfortunately, prudential
  motives hindered the publication of the whole evidence; the people,
  consequently, were still ignorant of the magnitude of the crime, and,
  till recently, biographers of Bacon have been in a like ignorance.<a
  name="FnAnchor_136" href="#Footnote_136"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The earl
  himself, before execution, confessed his guilt and the thorough justice
  of his sentence, while, with singular lack of magnanimity, he
  incriminated several against whom accusations had not been brought, among
  others his sister Lady Rich. After his execution it was thought necessary
  that some account of the facts should be drawn up and circulated, in
  order to remove the prejudice against the queen's action in the matter.
  This was entrusted to Bacon, who drew up a <i>Declaration of the
  Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert, late Earl of
  Essex</i>, his first draft being extensively altered and corrected by the
  queen and council. Nothing is known with certainty of the reception given
  to this official explanation, but the ill-feeling against Bacon was not
  wholly removed, and some years later, in 1604, he published, in the form
  of a letter to Mountjoy, an <i>Apology</i> for his action in the case.
  This <i>Apology</i> gives a most fair and temperate history of the
  relations between Bacon and Essex, shows how the prudent counsel of the
  one had been rejected by the other, and brings out very clearly what we
  conceive to be the true explanation of the matter. Everything that Bacon
  could do was done by him, until the real nature of Essex's design was
  made apparent, and then, as he had repeatedly told the earl, his devotion
  and respect were for the queen and state, not for any subject; friendship
  could never take rank above loyalty. Those who blame Bacon must acquit
  Essex of all wrong-doing.</p>

  <p>Bacon's private fortunes, during the period after the death of Essex,
  were not in a flourishing condition. He had obtained a grant of £1200
  from the fines imposed on Catesby, one of the conspirators, but his debts
  were sufficient to swallow up this and much more. And, though he was
  trusted by Elizabeth, and on good terms with her, he seems to have seen
  that he had no chance of advancement. But her death in 1603, followed by
  the undisputed succession of James, gave him new hopes. He used every
  means in his power to bring himself under James's notice, writing to all
  his friends at the Scottish court and to the king himself. He managed to
  obtain a personal interview with the king, but does not seem to have been
  much satisfied with it. In fact, while the king confirmed in their
  situations those who had held crown offices under Elizabeth, Bacon, not
  holding his post by warrant, was practically omitted. He was, however,
  continued, by special order of the king, as learned counsel
  extraordinary, but little or no law business appears to have been
  entrusted to him. He procured, through his cousin Cecil, the dignity of
  knighthood, which, contrary to his inclination, he received along with
  about 300 others, on the 23rd of July 1603. Between this time and the
  opening of James's first parliament he was engaged in literary work, and
  sent to the king two pamphlets&mdash;one on the Union, the other on
  measures for the pacification of the church. Shortly after he published
  his <i>Apology</i>. In March 1604 parliament met, and during their short
  session Bacon's hands seem to have been full of work. It was a busy and
  stirring time, and events occurred during it which carried within them
  the seeds of much future dissension. Prerogative and privilege came more
  than once into collision, the abuses of purveyance and wardship were made
  matters of conference, though the thorough discussion of them was
  deferred to a succeeding session; while James's temper was irritated by
  the objections brought against his favourite scheme of the Union, and by
  the attitude taken up by the House with regard to religious affairs. The
  records are barely full enough to enable us to judge of the share taken
  by Bacon in these discussions; his name generally appears as the reporter
  of the committees on special subjects. We can occasionally, however,
  discern traces of his tact and remarkable prudence; and, on the whole,
  his attitude, particularly with regard to the Union question, recommended
  him to James. He was shortly afterwards formally installed as learned
  counsel, receiving the salary of £40, and at the same time a pension of
  £60 yearly. He was also appointed one of the commission to treat of the
  conditions necessary for the Union; and the admirable manner in which the
  duties of that body were discharged must be attributed mainly to his
  influence and his complete mastery of the subject. During the recess he
  published his <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, dedicated to the king.</p>

  <p>He was now brought into relations with James, and his prospects began
  to improve. It is important for us to know what were his ideas upon
  government, upon parliaments, prerogative, and so forth, since a
  knowledge of this will clear up much that would seem inexplicable in his
  life. It seems quite evident<a name="FnAnchor_137"
  href="#Footnote_137"><sup>[7]</sup></a> that Bacon, from position, early
  training and, one might almost think, natural inclination, held as his
  ideal of government the Elizabethan system. The king was the supreme
  power, the centre of law and justice, and his prerogative must not be
  infringed. Parliament was merely a body called to consult with the king
  on emergencies (<i>circa ardua regni</i>) and to grant supplies. King and
  parliament together make up the state, but the former is first in nature
  and importance. The duty of a statesman was, therefore, to carry out the
  royal will in as prudent a manner as possible; he was the servant of the
  king, and stood or fell according to his pleasure. He was not singular in
  his opinions and he was undoubtedly sincere; and it is only <!-- Page 139
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[v.03 p.0139]</span>by
  keeping them constantly in mind that we can understand his after
  relations with the king.</p>

  <p>In the second parliament there was not so much scope for the exercise
  of his powers. The Gunpowder Plot had aroused in the Commons warmer
  feelings towards the king; they passed severe laws against recusants, and
  granted a triple subsidy. At the same time they continued the collection
  of the grievances concerning which they were to move. In the course of
  this session Bacon married Alice Barnham "the alderman's daughter, an
  handsome maiden, to my liking," of whom he had written some years before
  to his cousin Cecil. Little or nothing is known of their married
  life.</p>

  <p>The third parliament was chiefly occupied with the commercial and
  legal questions rising out of the proposed Union, in particular, with the
  dispute as to the naturalization of the <i>Post Nati</i>. Bacon argued
  ably in favour of this measure, but the general feeling was against it.
  The House would only pass a bill abolishing hostile laws between the
  kingdoms; but the case of the <i>Post Nati</i>, being brought before the
  law courts, was settled as the king wished. Bacon's services were
  rewarded in June 1607 by the office of solicitor.<a name="FnAnchor_138"
  href="#Footnote_138"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Several years passed before he
  gained another step. Meantime, though circumstances had thrown him too
  much into active life, he had not forgotten his cherished project of
  reorganizing natural science. A survey of the ground had been made in the
  <i>Advancement</i>, and some short pieces not published at the time were
  probably written in the subsequent two or three years. Towards the close
  of 1607 he sent to his friends a small tract, entitled <i>Cogitata et
  Visa</i>, probably the first draft of what we have under that title. In
  1609 he wrote the noble panegyric, <i>In felicem memoriam
  Elizabethae</i>, and the curiously learned and ingenious work, <i>De
  Sapientia Veterum</i>; and completed what seems to have been the
  <i>Redargutio Philosophiarum</i>, or treatise on the "idols of the
  theatre."</p>

  <p>In 1610 the famous fourth parliament of James met. Prerogative,
  despite Bacon's advice and efforts, clashed more than once with liberty;
  Salisbury's bold schemes for relieving the embarrassment caused by the
  reckless extravagance of the king proved abortive, and the House was
  dissolved in February 1611. Bacon took a considerable share in the
  debates, consistently upheld the prerogative, and seemed yet to possess
  the confidence of the Commons. The death of Salisbury, occurring soon
  after, opened a position in which Bacon thought his great political skill
  and sagacity might be made more immediately available for the king's
  service. How far he directly offered himself for the post of secretary is
  uncertain, but we know that his hopes were disappointed, the king himself
  undertaking the duties of the office. About the same time he made two
  ineffectual applications for the mastership of the wards; the first, on
  Salisbury's death, when it was given to Sir George Carey; the second, on
  the death of Carey. It is somewhat hard to understand why so little
  favour was shown by the king to one who had proved himself able and
  willing to do good service, and who, in spite of his disappointments,
  still continued zealously to offer advice and assistance. At last in
  1613, a fair opportunity for promotion occurred. The death of Sir Thomas
  Fleming made a vacancy in the chief justiceship of the king's bench, and
  Bacon, after some deliberation, proposed to the king that Coke should be
  removed from his place in the court of common pleas and transferred to
  the king's bench. He gives several reasons for this in his letter to the
  king, but in all probability his chief motive was that pointed out by
  Spedding, that in the court of king's bench there would be less danger of
  Coke coming into collision with the king on questions of prerogative, in
  handling which Bacon was always very circumspect and tender. The vacancy
  caused by Coke's promotion was then filled up by Hobart, and Bacon,
  finally, stepped into the place of attorney-general. The fact of this
  advice being offered and followed in all essentials, illustrates very
  clearly the close relations between the king and Bacon, who had become a
  confidential adviser on most occasions of difficulty. That his adherence
  to the royal party was already noticed and commented on appears from the
  significant remark of Chamberlain, who, after mentioning the recent
  changes among the law officials, says, "There is a strong apprehension
  that ... Bacon may prove a dangerous instrument."</p>

  <p>Further light is thrown upon Bacon's relations with James, and upon
  his political sympathies, by the letter to the king advocating the
  calling of a parliament,<a name="FnAnchor_139"
  href="#Footnote_139"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and by the two papers of notes on
  which his letter was founded.<a name="FnAnchor_1310"
  href="#Footnote_1310"><sup>[10]</sup></a> These documents, even after due
  weight is given to all considerations urged in their favour,<a
  name="FnAnchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311"><sup>[11]</sup></a> seem to
  confirm the view already taken of Bacon's theory of government, and at
  the same time show that his sympathies with the royal party tended to
  blind him to the true character of certain courses of action, which can
  only be justified by a straining of political ethics. The advice he
  offered, in all sincerity, was most prudent and sagacious, and
  <i>might</i> have been successfully carried out by a man of Bacon's tact
  and skill; but it was intensely one-sided, and exhibited a curious want
  of appreciation of what was even then beginning to be looked on as the
  true relation of king, parliament and people. Unfortunately for James, he
  could neither adopt nor carry out Bacon's policy. The parliament which
  met in April 1614, in which Bacon sat for Cambridge University, and was
  dissolved in June, after a stormy session, was by no means in a frame of
  mind suitable for the king's purposes. The House was enraged at the
  supposed project (then much misunderstood) of the "Undertakers";
  objection was taken to Bacon being elected or serving as a member while
  holding office as attorney-general; and, though an exception was made in
  his favour, it was resolved that no attorney-general should in future be
  eligible for a seat in parliament. No supply was granted, and the king's
  necessities were increased instead of diminished. The emergency suggested
  to some of the bishops the idea of a voluntary contribution, which was
  eagerly taken up by the noblemen and crown officials. The scheme was
  afterwards extended so as to take in the whole kingdom, but lost
  something of its voluntary character, and the means taken to raise the
  money, which were not what Bacon would have recommended,<a
  name="FnAnchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312"><sup>[12]</sup></a> were
  calculated to stir up discontent. The general dissatisfaction received a
  somewhat unguarded and intemperate expression in a letter sent to the
  justices of Marlborough by a gentleman of the neighbourhood, named Oliver
  St John,<a name="FnAnchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
  in which he denounced the attempt to raise funds in this way as contrary
  to law, reason and religion, as constituting in the king personally an
  act of perjury, involving in the same crime those who contributed, and
  thereby subjecting all parties to the curses levelled by the church at
  such offences. St John was summoned before the Star Chamber for slander
  and treasonable language; and Bacon, <i>ex officio</i>, acted as public
  prosecutor. The sentence pronounced (a fine of £5000 and imprisonment for
  life) was severe, but it was not actually inflicted, and probably was not
  intended to be carried out, the success of the prosecution being all that
  was desired. St John remained a short time in prison, and was then
  released, after making a full apology and submission. The fine was
  remitted. It seems incredible that Bacon's conduct on this occasion
  should have been censured by his biographers. The offence was clear; the
  law was undoubted; no particular sympathy was excited for the culprit;
  the sentence was not carried out; and Bacon did only what any one in his
  place would naturally and necessarily have done. The nature of his office
  involved him in several trials for treason occurring about the same time,
  and one of these is of interest sufficient to require a somewhat longer
  examination. Edmund Peacham<a name="FnAnchor_1314"
  href="#Footnote_1314"><sup>[14]</sup></a> had been <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[v.03 p.0140]</span>committed to
  custody for a libel on his superior, James Montagu (1568?-1618), bishop
  of Bath and Wells. In searching his house for certain papers, the
  officers came upon some loose sheets stitched together in the form of a
  sermon, the contents of which were of such a nature that it was judged
  right to lay them before the council. As it was at first suspected that
  the writing of this book had been prompted by some disaffected persons,
  Peacham was interrogated, and after he had declined to give any
  information, was subjected to torture. Bacon, as one of the learned
  counsel, was ordered by the council to take part in this examination,
  which was undoubtedly warranted by precedent, whatever may now be thought
  of it. Nothing, however, was extracted from Peacham in this way, and it
  was resolved to proceed against him for treason. Now, in the excited
  state of popular feeling at that period, the failure of government to
  substantiate an accusation of treason would have been a serious matter.
  The king, with whom the council agreed, seems therefore to have thought
  it desirable to obtain beforehand the opinions of the four chief judges
  as to whether the alleged offence amounted to treason. In this there was
  nothing unusual or illegal, and no objection would at that time have been
  made to it, but James introduced a certain innovation; he proposed that
  the opinions of the four judges should be given separately and in
  private. It may be reasonably inferred that his motive for this was the
  suspicion, or it may be the knowledge, that Coke did not consider the
  matter treasonable. At all events when Coke, who as a councillor already
  knew the facts of the case, was consulted regarding the new proposal of
  the king, he at once objected to it, saying that "this particular and
  auricular taking of opinions" was "new and dangerous," and "not according
  to the custom of the realm." He at last reluctantly assented, and
  proposed that Bacon should consult with him, while the other law officers
  addressed themselves to the three puisne judges. By Bacon's directions
  the proposal to the three judges to give their opinions separately was
  made suddenly and confidently, and any scruples they might have felt were
  easily overcome. The first step was thus gained, and it was hoped that if
  "infusion" could be avoided, if the papers bearing on the case were
  presented to the judges quickly, and before their minds could be swayed
  by extraneous influence, their decision on the case would be the same as
  that of the king. It is clear that the extraneous influence to be feared
  was Coke, who, on being addressed by Bacon, again objected to giving his
  opinion separately, and even seemed to hope that his brother judges after
  they had seen the papers would withdraw their assent to giving their
  decisions privately. Even after the discussion of the case with Bacon, he
  would not give his opinion until the others had handed in theirs. What
  the other judges thought is not definitely known, but Bacon appears to
  have been unable to put in operation the plan he had devised for swaying
  Coke's judgment,<a name="FnAnchor_1315"
  href="#Footnote_1315"><sup>[15]</sup></a> or if he did attempt it, he was
  unsuccessful, for Coke finally gave an opinion consistent with what he
  seems to have held at first, that the book was not treasonable, as it did
  not disable the king's title. Although the opinions of the judges were
  not made public, yet as we learn, not only from Bacon, but from a
  sentence in one of Carleton's letters,<a name="FnAnchor_1316"
  href="#Footnote_1316"><sup>[16]</sup></a> a rumour had got about that
  there was doubt as to the book being treasonable. Under these
  circumstances, Bacon, who feared that such a report might incite other
  people to attempt a similar offence, proposed to the king that a second
  rumour should be circulated in order to destroy the impression caused by
  the first. "I do think it necessary," he says, "that because we live in
  an age in which no counsel is kept, and that it is true there is some
  bruit abroad that the judges of the king's bench do doubt of the case
  that it should not be treason, that it be given out constantly, and yet
  as it were in secret, and so a fame to slide, that the doubt was only
  upon the publication, in that it was never published. For that (if your
  majesty marketh it) taketh away or at least qualifieth the danger of the
  example; for that will be no man's case."<a name="FnAnchor_1317"
  href="#Footnote_1317"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Bacon's conduct in this matter
  has been curiously misrepresented. He has been accused of torturing the
  prisoner, and of tampering with the judges<a name="FnAnchor_1318"
  href="#Footnote_1318"><sup>[18]</sup></a> by consulting them before the
  trial; nay, he is even represented as selecting this poor clergyman to
  serve for an example to terrify the disaffected, as breaking into his
  study and finding there a sermon never intended to be preached, which
  merely encouraged the people to resist tyranny.<a name="FnAnchor_1319"
  href="#Footnote_1319"><sup>[19]</sup></a> All this lavish condemnation
  rests on a complete misconception of the case. If any blame attaches to
  him, it must arise either from his endeavour to force Coke to a
  favourable decision, in which he was in all probability prompted by a
  feeling, not uncommon with him, that a matter of state policy was in
  danger of being sacrificed to some senseless legal quibble or precedent,
  or from his advice to the king that a rumour should be set afloat which
  was not strictly true.</p>

  <p>Bacon's share in another great trial which came on shortly afterwards,
  the Overbury and Somerset case, is not of such a nature as to render it
  necessary to enter upon it in detail.<a name="FnAnchor_1320"
  href="#Footnote_1320"><sup>[20]</sup></a> It may be noted, however, that
  his letters about this time show that he had become acquainted with the
  king's new favourite, the brilliant Sir George Villiers, and that he
  stood high in the king's good graces. In the early part of 1616, when
  Thomas Egerton, Baron Ellesmere (<i>c.</i> 1540-1617), the lord
  chancellor, was dangerously ill, Bacon wrote a long and careful letter to
  the king, proposing himself for the office, should it fall vacant, and
  stating as frankly as possible of what value he considered his services
  would be. In answer, he appears to have received a distinct promise of
  the reversion of the office; but, as Ellesmere recovered, the matter
  stood over for a time. He proposed, however, that he should be made a
  privy councillor, in order to give him more weight in his almost
  recognized position of adviser to the king, and on the 9th of June 1616
  he took the oaths and his seat at the council board.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his great rival Coke, whose constant tendency to limit the
  prerogative by law and precedent had made him an object of particular
  dislike to James, had on two points come into open collision with the
  king's rights. The first case was an action of <i>praemunire</i> against
  the court of chancery, evidently instigated by him, but brought at the
  instance of certain parties whose adversaries had obtained redress in the
  chancellor's court after the cause had been tried in the court of king's
  bench. With all his learning and ingenuity Coke failed in inducing or
  even forcing the jury to bring in a bill against the court of chancery,
  and it seems fairly certain that on the technical point of law involved
  he was wrong. Although his motive was, in great measure, a feeling of
  personal dislike towards Ellesmere, yet it is not improbable that he was
  influenced by the desire to restrict in every possible way the
  jurisdiction of a court which was the direct exponent of the king's
  wishes. The other case, that of the <i>commendams</i>, was more important
  in itself and in the circumstances connected with it. The general
  question involved in a special instance was whether or not the king's
  prerogative included the right of granting at pleasure livings <i>in
  commendam</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to be enjoyed by one who was not the
  incumbent. Bacon, as attorney-general, delivered a speech, which has not
  been reported; but the king was informed that the arguments on the other
  side had not been limited to the special case, but had directly impugned
  the general prerogative right of granting livings. It was necessary for
  James, as a party interested, at once to take measures to see that the
  decision of the judges should not be given on the general question
  without due consultation. He accordingly wrote to Bacon, directing him to
  intimate to the judges his pleasure that they should delay judgment until
  after discussion of the matter with himself. Bacon communicated first
  with Coke, who in reply desired that similar notice should be given to
  the other judges. This was done by Bacon, though he seems to hint that in
  so doing he was <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>[v.03 p.0141]</span>going a little beyond his
  instructions. The judges took no notice of the intimation, proceeded at
  once to give judgment, and sent a letter in their united names to the
  king announcing what they had done, and declaring that it was contrary to
  law and to their oath for them to pay any attention to a request that
  their decision should be delayed. The king was indignant at this
  encroachment, and acting partly on the advice of Bacon, held a council on
  the 6th of June 1616, at which the judges attended. James then entered at
  great length into the case, censuring the judges for the offensive form
  of their letter, and for not having delayed judgment upon his demand,
  which had been made solely because he was himself a party concerned. The
  judges, at the conclusion of his speech, fell on their knees, and
  implored pardon for the manner of their letter; but Coke attempted to
  justify the matter contained in it, saying that the delay required by his
  majesty was contrary to law. The point of law was argued by Bacon, and
  decided by the chancellor in favour of the king, who put the question to
  the judges individually, "Whether, if at any time, in a case depending
  before the judges, which his majesty conceived to concern him either in
  power or profit, and thereupon required to consult with them, and that
  they should stay proceedings in the meantime, they ought not to stay
  accordingly?" To this all gave assent except Coke, who said that "when
  the case should be, he would do that should be fit for a judge to do." No
  notice was taken by the king of this famous, though somewhat evasive,
  reply, But the judges were again asked what course they would take in the
  special case now before them. They all declared that they would not
  decide the matter upon general grounds affecting the prerogative, but
  upon special circumstances incident to the case; and with this answer
  they were dismissed. Bacon's conduct throughout the affair has been
  blamed, but apparently on wrong grounds. As attorney he was merely
  fulfilling his duty in obeying the command of the king; and in laying
  down the law on the disputed point, he was, we may be sure, speaking his
  own convictions. Censure might more reasonably be bestowed on him because
  he deliberately advised a course of action than which nothing can be
  conceived better calculated to strengthen the hands of an absolute
  monarch.<a name="FnAnchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
  This appeared to Bacon justifiable and right, because the prerogative
  would be defended and preserved intact. Coke certainly stands out in a
  better light, not so much for his answer, which was rather indefinite,
  and the force of which is much weakened by his assent to the second
  question of the king, but for the general spirit of resistance to
  encroachment exhibited by him. He was undeniably troublesome to the king,
  and it is no matter for wonder that James resolved to remove him from a
  position where he could do so much harm. On the 26th June he was called
  before the council to answer certain charges, one of which was his
  conduct in the <i>praemunire</i> question. He acknowledged his error on
  that head, and made little defence. On the 30th he was suspended from
  council and bench, and ordered to employ his leisure in revising certain
  obnoxious opinions in his reports. He did not perform the task to the
  king's satisfaction, and a few months later he was dismissed from
  office.</p>

  <p>Bacon's services to the king's cause had been most important; and as
  he had, at the same time, acquired great favour with Villiers, his
  prospects looked brighter than before. According to his custom, he strove
  earnestly to guide by his advice the conduct of the young favourite. His
  letters, in which he analyses the various relations in which such a man
  must stand, and prescribes the course of action suitable for each, are
  valuable and deserving of attention.<a name="FnAnchor_1322"
  href="#Footnote_1322"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Very striking, in view of
  future events, are the words<a name="FnAnchor_1323"
  href="#Footnote_1323"><sup>[23]</sup></a> in which he gives him counsel
  as to his dealing with judges: "By no means be you persuaded to interpose
  yourself by word or letter in any cause depending, or like to be
  depending, in any court of justice, nor suffer any man to do it where you
  can hinder it; and by all means dissuade the king himself from it, upon
  the importunity of any, either for their friends or themselves. If it
  should prevail, it perverts justice; but if the judge be so just, and of
  so undaunted a courage (as he ought to be) as not to be inclined thereby,
  yet it always leaves a taint of suspicions and prejudice behind it." It
  is probable that Villiers at this time had really a sense of the duties
  attaching to his position<a name="FnAnchor_1324"
  href="#Footnote_1324"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and was willing to be guided by
  a man of approved wisdom. It was not long before an opportunity occurred
  for showing his gratitude and favour. Ellesmere resigned the
  chancellorship on the 5th of March 1616/7, and on the 7th the great seal
  was bestowed upon Bacon, with the title of lord keeper. Two months later
  he took his seat with great pomp in the chancery court, and delivered a
  weighty and impressive opening discourse. He entered with great vigour on
  his new labours, and in less than a month he was able to report to
  Buckingham that he had cleared off all outstanding chancery cases. He
  seemed now to have reached the height of his ambition; he was the first
  law officer in the kingdom, the accredited minister of his sovereign, and
  on the best terms with the king and his favourite. His course seemed
  perfectly prosperous and secure, when a slight storm arising opened his
  eyes to the frailty of the tenure by which he held his position.</p>

  <p>Coke was in disgrace but not in despair; there seemed to be a way
  whereby he could reconcile himself to Buckingham, through the marriage of
  his daughter, who had an ample fortune, to Sir John Villiers, brother of
  the marquess, who was penniless or nearly so. The match was distasteful
  to Lady Hatton and to her daughter; a violent quarrel was the
  consequence, and Bacon, who thought the proposed marriage most
  unsuitable, took Lady Hatton's part. His reasons for disapproval he
  explained to the king and Buckingham, but found to his surprise that
  their indignation was strongly roused against him. He received from both
  bitter letters of reproof; it was rumoured that he would be disgraced,
  and Buckingham was said to have compared his present conduct to his
  previous unfaithfulness to Essex. Bacon, who seems to have acted from a
  simple desire to do the best for Buckingham's own interests, at once
  changed his course, advanced the match by every means in his power, and
  by a humble apology appeased the indignation that had been excited
  against him. It had been a sharp lesson, but things seemed to go on
  smoothly after it, and Bacon's affairs prospered.</p>

  <p>On the 4th of January 1617/8 he received the higher title of lord
  chancellor; in July of the same year he was made Baron Verulam and in
  January 1620/1 he was created Viscount St Albans. His fame, too, had been
  increased by the publication in 1620 of his most celebrated work, the
  <i>Novum Organum</i>. He seemed at length to have made satisfactory
  progress towards the realization of his cherished aims; the method
  essential for his Instauration was partially completed; and he had
  attained as high a rank in the state as he had ever contemplated. But his
  actions in that position were not calculated to promote the good of his
  country.</p>

  <p>Connected with the years during which he held office is one of the
  weightiest charges against his character. Buckingham, notwithstanding the
  advice he had received from Bacon himself, was in the habit of addressing
  letters to him recommending the causes of suitors. In many cases these
  seem nothing more than letters of courtesy, and, from the general tone,
  it might fairly be concluded that there was no intention to sway the
  opinion of the judge illegally, and that Bacon did not understand the
  letters in that sense. This view is supported by consideration of the few
  answers to them which are extant.<a name="FnAnchor_1325"
  href="#Footnote_1325"><sup>[25]</sup></a> One outstanding case, however,
  that of Dr Steward,<a name="FnAnchor_1326"
  href="#Footnote_1326"><sup>[26]</sup></a> casts some suspicion on all the
  others. The terms of Buckingham's note<a name="FnAnchor_1327"
  href="#Footnote_1327"><sup>[27]</sup></a> concerning it might easily have
  aroused doubts; and we find that the further course of the action was to
  all appearances exactly accommodated to Dr Steward, who <!-- Page 142
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[v.03 p.0142]</span>had
  been so strongly recommended. It is, of course, dangerous to form an
  extreme judgment on an isolated and partially understood case, of which
  also we have no explanation from Bacon himself, but if the interpretation
  advanced by Heath be the true one, Bacon certainly suffered his first,
  and, so far as we can see, just judgment on the case to be set aside, and
  the whole matter to be reopened in obedience to a request from
  Buckingham.</p>

  <p>It is somewhat hard to understand Bacon's position with regard to the
  king during these years. He was the first officer of the crown, the most
  able man in the kingdom, prudent, sagacious and devoted to the royal
  party. Yet his advice was followed only when it chimed in with James's
  own will; his influence was of a merely secondary kind; and his great
  practical skill was employed simply in carrying out the measures of the
  king in the best mode possible. We know indeed that he sympathized
  cordially with the home policy of the government; he had no objection to
  such monopolies or patents as seemed advantageous to the country, and for
  this he is certainly not to be blamed.<a name="FnAnchor_1328"
  href="#Footnote_1328"><sup>[28]</sup></a> The opinion was common at the
  time, and the error was merely ignorance of the true principles of
  political economy. But we know also that the patents were so numerous as
  to be oppressive, and we can scarcely avoid inferring that Bacon more
  readily saw the advantages to the government than the disadvantages to
  the people. In November 1620, when a new parliament was summoned to meet
  on January following, he earnestly pressed that the most obnoxious
  patents, those of alehouses and inns, and the monopoly of gold and silver
  thread, should be given up, and wrote to Buckingham, whose brothers were
  interested, advising him to withdraw them from the impending storm. This
  prudent advice was unfortunately rejected. But while he went cordially
  with the king in domestic affairs, he was not quite in harmony with him
  on questions of foreign policy. Not only was he personally in favour of a
  war with Spain for the recovery of the Palatinate, but he foresaw in such
  a course of action the means of drawing together more closely the king
  and his parliament. He believed that the royal difficulties would be
  removed if a policy were adopted with which the people could heartily
  sympathize, and if the king placed himself at the head of his parliament
  and led them on. But his advice was neglected by the vacillating and
  peace-loving monarch, his proffered proclamation was put aside, and a
  weak, featureless production substituted in its place. Nevertheless the
  new parliament seemed at first more responsive than might have been
  looked for. A double subsidy was granted, which was expressly stated to
  be "not on any consideration or condition for or concerning the
  Palatinate." The session, however, was not far advanced when the question
  of patents was brought up; a determined attack was made upon the very
  ones of which Bacon had been in dread, and it was even proposed to
  proceed against the referees (Bacon and Montagu) who had certified that
  there was no objection to them in point of law. This proposal, though
  pressed by Coke, was allowed to drop; while the king and Buckingham,
  acting under the advice of Williams, afterwards lord keeper, agreed to
  give up the monopolies. It was evident, however, that a determined attack
  was about to be made upon Bacon, and that the proceeding against the
  referees was really directed against him. It is probable that this charge
  was dropped because a more powerful weapon had in the meantime been
  placed in his enemies' hands. This was the accusation of bribery and
  corrupt dealings in chancery suits, an accusation apparently wholly
  unexpected by Bacon, and the possibility of which he seems never to have
  contemplated until it was actually brought against him. At the beginning
  of the session a committee had been appointed for inquiring into abuses
  in the courts of justice. Some illegal practices of certain chancery
  officials had been detected and punished by the court itself, and
  generally there was a disposition to overhaul its affairs, while Coke and
  Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex (1575-1645) directly attacked some
  parts of the chancellor's administration. But on the 14th of March one
  Christopher Aubrey appeared at the bar of the House, and charged Bacon
  with having received from him a sum of money while his suit was going on,
  and with having afterwards decided against him. Bacon's letter<a
  name="FnAnchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329"><sup>[29]</sup></a> on this
  occasion is worthy of serious attention; he evidently thought the charge
  was but part of the deliberate scheme to ruin him which had already been
  in progress. A second accusation (Edward Egerton's case) followed
  immediately after, and was investigated by the House, who, satisfied that
  they had just matter for reprehension, appointed the 19th for a
  conference with the Lords. On that day Bacon, as he had feared, was too
  ill to attend. He wrote<a name="FnAnchor_1330"
  href="#Footnote_1330"><sup>[30]</sup></a> to the Lords excusing his
  absence, requesting them to appoint a convenient time for his defence and
  cross-examination of witnesses, and imploring them not to allow their
  minds to be prejudiced against him, at the same time declaring that he
  would not "trick up an innocency with cavillations, but plainly and
  ingenuously declare what he knew or remembered." The charges rapidly
  accumulated, but Bacon still looked upon them as party moves, and was in
  hopes of defending himself.<a name="FnAnchor_1331"
  href="#Footnote_1331"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Nor did he seem to have lost
  his courage, if we are to believe the common reports of the day,<a
  name="FnAnchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332"><sup>[32]</sup></a> though
  certainly they do not appear worthy of very much credit.</p>

  <p>The notes<a name="FnAnchor_1333"
  href="#Footnote_1333"><sup>[33]</sup></a> bearing upon the interview
  which he obtained with the king show that he had begun to see more
  clearly the nature and extent of the offences with which he was charged,
  that he now felt it impossible altogether to exculpate himself, and that
  his hopes were directed towards obtaining some mitigation of his
  sentence. The long roll of charges made upon the 19th of April finally
  decided him; he gave up all idea of defence, and wrote to the king
  begging him to show him favour in this emergency.<a name="FnAnchor_1334"
  href="#Footnote_1334"><sup>[34]</sup></a> The next day he sent in a
  general confession to the Lords,<a name="FnAnchor_1335"
  href="#Footnote_1335"><sup>[35]</sup></a> trusting that this would be
  considered satisfactory. The Lords, however, decided that it was not
  sufficient as a ground for their censure, and demanded a detailed and
  particular confession. A list of twenty-eight charges was then sent him,
  to which an answer by letter was required. On the 30th of April his
  "confession and humble submission"<a name="FnAnchor_1336"
  href="#Footnote_1336"><sup>[36]</sup></a> was handed in. In it, after
  going over the several instances, he says, "I do again confess, that on
  the points charged upon me, although they should be taken as myself have
  declared them, there is a great deal of corruption and neglect; for which
  I am heartily and penitently sorry, and submit myself to the judgment,
  grace, and mercy of the court."<a name="FnAnchor_1337"
  href="#Footnote_1337"><sup>[37]</sup></a> On the 3rd of May, after
  considerable discussion, the Lords decided upon the sentence, which
  was,<a name="FnAnchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
  That he should undergo fine and ransom of £40,000; that he should be
  imprisoned in the Tower during the king's pleasure; that he should be for
  ever incapable of any office, place or employment in the state or
  commonwealth; that he should never sit in parliament, or come within the
  verge of the court. This heavy sentence was <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[v.03 p.0143]</span>only partially
  executed. The fine was in effect remitted by the king; imprisonment in
  the Tower lasted for about four days; a general pardon (not of course
  covering the parliamentary censure) was made out, and though delayed at
  the seal for a time by Lord Keeper Williams, was passed probably in
  November 1621. The cause of the delay seems to have lain with Buckingham,
  whose friendship had cooled, and who had taken offence at the fallen
  chancellor's unwillingness to part with York House. This difference was
  finally smoothed over, and it was probably through his influence that
  Bacon received the much-desired permission to come within the verge of
  the court. He never again sat in parliament.</p>

  <p>So ends this painful episode, which has given rise to the most severe
  condemnation of Bacon, and which still presents great and perhaps
  insuperable difficulties. On the whole, the tendency of the most recent
  and thorough researches has been towards the opinion that Bacon's own
  account of the matter (from which, indeed, our knowledge of it is chiefly
  drawn) is substantially correct. He distinguishes three ways in which
  bribes may be given,<a name="FnAnchor_1339"
  href="#Footnote_1339"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and ingenuously confesses that
  his own acts amounted to corruption and were worthy of condemnation. Now,
  corruption strictly interpreted would imply the deliberate sale of
  justice, and this Bacon explicitly denies, affirming that he never "had
  bribe or reward in his eye or thought when he pronounced any sentence or
  order." When we analyse the specific charges against him, with his
  answers to them, we find many that are really of little weight. The
  twenty-eighth and last, that of negligence in looking after his servants,
  though it did him much harm, may fairly be said to imply no moral blame.
  The majority of the others are instances of gratuities given after the
  decision, and it is to be regretted that the judgment of the peers gives
  us no means of determining how such gifts were looked upon, whether or
  not the acceptance of them was regarded as a "corrupt" practice. In four
  cases specifically, and in some others by implication, Bacon confesses
  that he had received bribes from suitors <i>pendente lite</i>. Yet he
  affirms, as we said before, that his intention was never swayed by a
  bribe; and so far as any of these cases can be traced, his decisions,
  often given in conjunction with some other official, are to all
  appearance thoroughly just. In several cases his judgment appears to have
  been given against the party bestowing the bribe, and in at least one
  instance, that of Lady Wharton, it seems impossible to doubt that he must
  have known when accepting the present that his opinion would be adverse
  to her cause. Although, then, he felt that these practices were really
  corrupt, and even rejoiced that his own fall would tend to purify the
  courts from them,<a name="FnAnchor_1340"
  href="#Footnote_1340"><sup>[40]</sup></a> he did not feel that he was
  guilty of perverting justice for the sake of reward. How far, then, is
  such defence or explanation admissible and satisfactory? It is clear that
  two things are to be considered: the one the guilt of taking bribes or
  presents on any consideration, the other the moral guilt depending upon
  the wilful perversion of justice. The attempt has sometimes been made to
  defend the whole of Bacon's conduct on the ground that he did nothing
  that was not done by many of his contemporaries. Bacon himself disclaims
  a defence of this nature, and we really have no direct evidence which
  shows to what extent the offering and receiving of such bribes then
  prevailed. That the practice was common is indeed implied by the terms in
  which Bacon speaks of it, and it is not improbable that the fact of these
  gifts being taken by officials was a thing fairly well known, although
  all were aware of their illegal character, and it was plain that any
  public exposure of such dealings would be fatal to the individual against
  whom the charge was made out.<a name="FnAnchor_1341"
  href="#Footnote_1341"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Bacon knew all this; he was
  well aware that the practice was in itself indefensible,<a
  name="FnAnchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342"><sup>[42]</sup></a> and that
  his conduct was therefore corrupt and deserving of censure. So far, then,
  as the mere taking of bribes is concerned, he would permit no defence,
  and his own confession and judgment on his action contain as severe a
  condemnation as has ever been passed upon him. Yet in the face of this he
  does not hesitate to call himself "the justest chancellor that hath been
  in the five changes since Sir Nicholas Bacon's time";<a
  name="FnAnchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and this
  on the plea that his intentions had always been pure, and had never been
  affected by the presents he received. His justification has been set
  aside by modern critics, not on the ground that the evidence demonstrates
  its falsity,<a name="FnAnchor_1344"
  href="#Footnote_1344"><sup>[44]</sup></a> but because it is inconceivable
  or unnatural that any man should receive a present from another, and not
  suffer his judgment to be swayed thereby. It need hardly be said that
  such an <i>a priori</i> conviction is not a sufficient basis on which to
  found a sweeping condemnation of Bacon's integrity as an administrator of
  justice. On the other hand, even if it be admitted to be possible and
  conceivable that a present should be given by a suitor simply as seeking
  favourable consideration of his cause, and not as desirous of obtaining
  an unjust decree, and should be accepted by the judge on the same
  understanding, this would not entitle one absolutely to accept Bacon's
  statement. Further evidence is necessary in order to give foundation to a
  definite judgment either way; and it is extremely improbable, nay, almost
  impossible, that such can ever be produced. In these circumstances, due
  weight should be given to Bacon's own assertions of his perfect innocence
  and purity of intention; they ought not to be put out of court unless
  found in actual contradiction to the facts, and the reverse of this is
  the case, so far as has yet appeared.<a name="FnAnchor_1345"
  href="#Footnote_1345"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The remaining five years of his life, though he was still harassed by
  want of means, for James was not liberal, were spent in work far more
  valuable to the world than anything he had accomplished in his high
  office. In March 1622 he presented to Prince Charles his <i>History of
  Henry VII.</i>; and immediately, with unwearied industry, set to work to
  complete some portions of his great work. In November 1622 appeared the
  <i>Historia Ventorum</i>; in January 1622/3, the <i>Historia Vitae et
  Mortis</i>; and in October of the same year, the <i>De Augmentis
  Scientiarum</i>, a Latin translation, with many additions, of the
  <i>Advancement</i>. Finally, in December 1624, he published his
  <i>Apophthegms</i>, and <i>Translations of some of the Psalms</i>,
  dedicated to George Herbert; and, in 1625, a third and enlarged edition
  of the <i>Essays</i>.</p>

  <p>Busily occupied with these labours, his life now drew rapidly to a
  close. In March 1626 he came to London, and when driving one day near
  Highgate, was taken with a desire to discover whether snow would act as
  an antiseptic. He stopped his carriage, got out at a cottage, purchased a
  fowl, and with his own hands assisted to stuff it with snow. He was
  seized with a sudden chill, and became so seriously unwell that he had to
  be conveyed to Lord Arundel's house, which was near at hand. Here his
  illness increased, the cold and chill brought on bronchitis and he died,
  after a few days' suffering, on the 9th of April 1626.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Bacon's Works and Philosophy.</i></p>

  <p>A complete survey of Bacon's works and an estimate of his place in
  literature and philosophy are matters for a volume. It is here proposed
  merely to classify the works, to indicate their general character and to
  enter somewhat more in detail upon what he himself regarded as his great
  achievement,&mdash;the reorganization of the sciences and the exposition
  of a new method by which the human mind might proceed with security and
  certainty towards the true end of all human thought and action.</p>

  <p>Putting aside the letters and occasional writings, we may conveniently
  distribute the other works into three classes, <i>Professional, Literary,
  Philosophical</i>. The Professional works include the <i>Reading on the
  Statute of Uses</i>, the <i>Maxims of Law</i> and the treatise (possibly
  spurious) on the <i>Use of the Law</i>. "I am in good hope," said Bacon
  himself, "that when Sir Edward Coke's reports and my rules and decisions
  shall come to posterity, there will be (whatsoever is now thought)
  question who was the greater lawyer." If Coke's reports show completer
  mastery of technical details, greater knowledge of precedent, and more of
  the dogged grasp of the letter than do Bacon's legal writings, there can
  be no dispute that the latter exhibit an infinitely more comprehensive
  intelligence of the abstract principles of jurisprudence, with a richness
  and ethical fulness that more than compensate for their lack of dry legal
  detail. Bacon seems indeed to have been a lawyer of the first order, with
  a keen scientific insight into the bearings of isolated facts and a power
  of generalization which admirably fitted him for the self-imposed task,
  unfortunately never completed, of digesting or codifying the chaotic mass
  of the English law.</p>

  <p>Among the literary works are included all that he himself designated
  moral and historical pieces, and to these may be added some theological
  and minor writings, such as the <i>Apophthegms</i>. Of the moral works
  the most valuable are the <i>Essays</i>, which have been so widely read
  and universally admired. The matter is of the familiar, practical kind,
  that "comes home to men's bosoms." The thoughts are weighty, and even
  when not original have acquired a peculiar and unique tone or cast by
  passing through the crucible of Bacon's mind. A sentence from the
  <i>Essays</i> can rarely be mistaken for the production of any other
  writer. The short, pithy sayings have become popular mottoes and
  household words. The style is quaint, original, abounding in allusions
  and witticisms, and rich, even to gorgeousness, with piled-up analogies
  and metaphors.<a name="FnAnchor_1346"
  href="#Footnote_1346"><sup>[46]</sup></a> The first edition contained
  only ten essays, but the number was increased in 1612 to thirty-eight,
  and in 1625 to fifty-eight. The short tract, <i>Colours of Good and
  Evil</i>, which with the <i>Meditationes Sacrae</i> originally
  accompanied the Essays, was afterwards incorporated with the <i>De
  Augmentis</i>. Along with these works may be classed the curiously
  learned piece, <i>De Sapientia Veterum</i>, in which he works out a
  favourite idea, that the mythological fables of the Greeks were
  allegorical and concealed the deepest truths of their philosophy. As a
  scientific explanation of the myths the theory is of no value, but it
  affords fine scope for the exercise of Bacon's unrivalled power of
  detecting analogies in things apparently most dissimilar. The
  <i>Apophthegms</i>, though hardly deserving Macaulay's praise of being
  the best collection of jests in the world, contain a number of those
  significant anecdotes which Bacon used with such effect in his other
  writings. Of the historical works, besides a few fragments of the
  projected history of Britain there remains the <i>History of Henry
  VII.</i>, a valuable work, giving a clear and animated narrative of the
  reign, and characterizing Henry with great skill. The style is in harmony
  with the matter, vigorous and flowing, but naturally with less of the
  quaintness and richness suitable to more thoughtful and original
  writings. The series of the literary works is completed by the minor
  treatises on theological or ecclesiastical questions. Some of the latter,
  included among the occasional works, are sagacious and prudent and
  deserve careful study. Of the former, the principal specimens are the
  <i>Meditationes Sacrae</i> and the <i>Confession of Faith</i>. The
  <i>Paradoxes</i> (Characters of a believing Christian in paradoxes, and
  seeming contradictions), which was often and justly suspected, has been
  conclusively proved by Grosart to be the work of another author.</p>

  <p><i>Philosophical Works.</i>&mdash;The great mass of Bacon's writings
  consists of treatises or fragments, which either formed integral parts of
  his grand comprehensive scheme, or were closely connected with it. More
  exactly they may be classified under three heads: (A) Writings originally
  intended to form parts of the <i>Instauratio</i>, but which were
  afterwards superseded or thrown aside; (B) Works connected with the
  <i>Instauratio</i>, but not directly included in its plan; (C) Writings
  which actually formed part of the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>.</p>

  <p>(A) This class contains some important tracts, which certainly contain
  little, if anything, that is not afterwards taken up and expanded in the
  more elaborate works, but are not undeserving of attention, from the
  difference in the point of view and method of treatment. The most
  valuable of them are: (1) <i>The Advancement of Learning</i>, of which no
  detailed account need be given, as it is completely worked up into the
  <i>De Augmentis</i>, and takes its place as the first part of the
  <i>Instauratio</i>. (2) <i>Valerius Terminus</i>, a very remarkable
  piece, composed probably about 1603, though perhaps retouched at a later
  period. It contains a brief and somewhat obscure outline of the first two
  parts in the <i>Instauratio</i>, and is of importance as affording us
  some insight into the gradual development of the system in Bacon's own
  mind. (3) <i>Temporis Partus Masculus</i>, another curious fragment,
  remarkable not only from its contents, but from its style, which is
  arrogant and offensive, in this respect unlike any other writing of
  Bacon's. The adjective <i>masculus</i> points to the power of bringing
  forth fruit possessed by the new philosophy, and perhaps indicates that
  all previous births of time were to be looked upon as feminine or
  imperfect; it is used in a somewhat similar sense in <i>Letters and
  Life</i>, vi. 183, "<i>In verbis masculis</i>, no flourishing or painted
  words, but such words as are fit to go before deeds." (4) <i>Redargutio
  Philosophiarum</i>, a highly finished piece in the form of an oration,
  composed probably about 1608 or 1609, and containing in pretty full
  detail much of what afterwards appears in connexion with the <i>Idola
  Theatri</i> in book i. of the <i>Novum Organum</i>. (5) <i>Cogitata et
  Visa</i>, perhaps the most important of the minor philosophical writings,
  dating from 1607 (though possibly the tract in its present form may have
  been to some extent altered), and containing in weighty and sonorous
  Latin the substance of the first book of the <i>Organum</i>. (6) The
  <i>Descriptio Globi Intellectualis</i>, which is to some extent
  intermediate between the <i>Advancement</i> and the <i>De Augmentis</i>,
  goes over in detail the general classification of the sciences, and
  enters particularly on some points of minor interest. (7) The brief tract
  <i>De Interpretatione Naturae Sententiae Duodecim</i> is evidently a
  first sketch of part of the <i>Novum Organum</i>, and in phraseology is
  almost identical with it. (8) A few smaller pieces, such as the
  <i>Inquisitio de Motu</i>, the <i>Calor et Frigus</i>, the <i>Historia
  Soni et Auditus</i> and the <i>Phaenomena Universi</i>, are early
  specimens of his <i>Natural History</i>, and exhibit the first tentative
  applications of the new method.</p>

  <p>(B) The second group consists of treatises on subjects connected with
  the <i>Instauratio</i>, but not forming part of it. The most interesting,
  and in many respects the most remarkable, is the philosophic romance, the
  <i>New Atlantis</i>, a description of an ideal state in which the
  principles of the new philosophy are carried out by political machinery
  and under state guidance, and where many of the results contemplated by
  Bacon are in imagination attained. The work was to have been completed by
  the addition of a second part, treating of the laws of a model
  commonwealth, which was never written. Another important tract is the
  <i>De Principiis atque Originibus secundum Fabulas Cupidinis et
  Caeli</i>, where, under the disguise of two old mythological stories, he
  (in the manner of the <i>Sapientia Veterum</i>) finds the deepest truths
  <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[v.03
  p.0145]</span>concealed. The tract is unusually interesting, for in it he
  discusses at some length the limits of science, the origin of things and
  the nature of primitive matter, giving at the same time full notices of
  Democritus among the ancient philosophers and of Telesio among the
  modern. Deserving of attention are also the <i>Cogitationes de Natura
  Rerum</i>, probably written early, perhaps in 1605, and the treatise on
  the theory of the tides, <i>De Fluxu et Refluxu Maris</i>, written
  probably about 1616.</p>

  <p>(C) The philosophical works which form part of the <i>Instauratio</i>
  must of course be classed according to the positions which they
  respectively hold in that scheme of the sciences.</p>

  <p>The great work, the reorganization of the sciences, and the
  restoration of man to that command over nature which he had lost by the
  fall, consisted in its final form of six divisions.</p>

  <p>I. <i>Partitiones Scientiarum</i>, a survey of the sciences, either
  such as then existed or such as required to be constructed
  afresh&mdash;in fact, an inventory of all the possessions of the human
  mind. The famous classification<a name="FnAnchor_1347"
  href="#Footnote_1347"><sup>[47]</sup></a> on which this survey proceeds
  is based upon an analysis of the faculties and objects of human
  knowledge. This division is represented by the <i>De Augmentis
  Scientiarum</i>.</p>

  <p>II. <i>Interpretatio Naturae.</i>&mdash;After the survey of all that
  has yet been done in the way of discovery or invention, comes the new
  method, by which the mind of man is to be trained and directed in its
  progress towards the renovation of science. This division is represented,
  though only imperfectly, by the <i>Novum Organum</i>, particularly book
  ii.</p>

  <p>III. <i>Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis.</i>&mdash;The new method
  is valueless, because inapplicable, unless it be supplied with materials
  duly collected and presented&mdash;in fact, unless there be formed a
  competent natural history of the <i>Phaenomena Universi</i>. A short
  introductory sketch of the requisites of such a natural history, which,
  according to Bacon, is essential, necessary, the <i>basis totius
  negotii</i>, is given in the tract <i>Parasceve</i>, appended to the
  <i>Novum Organum</i>. The principal works intended to form portions of
  the history, and either published by himself or left in manuscript, are
  <i>Historia Ventorum</i>, <i>Historia Vitae et Mortis</i>, <i>Historia
  Densi et Rari</i>, and the extensive collection of facts and observations

  <p>IV. <i>Scala Intellectus.</i>&mdash;It might have been supposed that
  the new philosophy could now be inaugurated. Materials had been supplied,
  along with a new method by which they were to be treated, and naturally
  the next step would be the finished result. But for practical purposes
  Bacon interposed two divisions between the preliminaries and the
  philosophy itself. The first was intended to consist of types or examples
  of investigations conducted by the new method, serviceable for keeping
  the whole process vividly before the mind, or, as the title indicates,
  such that the mind could run rapidly up and down the several steps or
  grades in the process. Of this division there seems to be only one small
  fragment, the <i>Filum Labyrinthi</i>, consisting of but two or three
  pages.</p>

  <p>V. <i>Prodromi</i>, forerunners of the new philosophy. This part,
  strictly speaking, is quite extraneous to the general design. According
  to the <i>Distributio Operis</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_1348"
  href="#Footnote_1348"><sup>[48]</sup></a> it was to contain certain
  speculations of Bacon's own, not formed by the new method, but by the
  unassisted use of his understanding. These, therefore, form temporary or
  uncertain anticipations of the new philosophy. There is extant a short
  preface to this division of the work, and according to Spedding some of
  the miscellaneous treatises, such as <i>De Principiis</i>, <i>De Fluxu et
  Refluxu</i>, <i>Cogitationes de Natura Rerum</i>, may probably have been
  intended to be included under this head. This supposition receives some
  support from the manner in which the fifth part is spoken of in the
  <i>Novum Organum</i>, i. 116.</p>

  <p>VI. The new philosophy, which is the work of future ages, and the
  result of the new method.</p>

  <p>Bacon's grand motive in his attempt to found the sciences anew was the
  intense conviction that the knowledge man possessed was of little service
  to him. "The knowledge whereof the world is now possessed, especially
  that of nature, extendeth not to magnitude and certainty of works."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Man's
  sovereignty over nature, which is founded on knowledge alone, had been
  lost, and instead of the free relation between things and the human mind,
  there was nothing but vain notions and blind experiments. To restore the
  original commerce between man and nature, and to recover the <i>imperium
  hominis</i>, is the grand object of all science. The want of success
  which had hitherto attended efforts in the same direction had been due to
  many causes, but chiefly to the want of appreciation of the nature of
  philosophy and its real aim. Philosophy is not the science of things
  divine and human; it is not the search after truth. "I find that even
  those that have sought knowledge for itself, and not for benefit or
  ostentation, or any practical enablement in the course of their life,
  have nevertheless propounded to themselves a wrong mark, namely,
  satisfaction (which men call Truth) and not operation."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350"><sup>[50]</sup></a> "Is there
  any such happiness as for a man's mind to be raised above the confusion
  of things, where he may have the prospect of the order of nature and
  error of man? But is this a view of delight only and not of discovery? of
  contentment and not of benefit? Shall he not as well discern the riches
  of nature's warehouse as the beauty of her shop? Is truth ever barren?
  Shall he not be able thereby to produce worthy effects, and to endow the
  life of man with infinite commodities?"<a name="FnAnchor_1351"
  href="#Footnote_1351"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Philosophy is altogether
  practical; it is of little matter to the fortunes of humanity what
  abstract notions one may entertain concerning the nature and the
  principles of things.<a name="FnAnchor_1352"
  href="#Footnote_1352"><sup>[52]</sup></a> This truth, however, has never
  yet been recognized;<a name="FnAnchor_1353"
  href="#Footnote_1353"><sup>[53]</sup></a> it has not yet been seen that
  the true aim of all science is "to endow the condition and life of man
  with new powers or works,"<a name="FnAnchor_1354"
  href="#Footnote_1354"><sup>[54]</sup></a> or "to extend more widely the
  limits of the power and greatness of man."<a name="FnAnchor_1355"
  href="#Footnote_1355"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Nevertheless, it is not to be
  imagined that by this being proposed as the great object of search there
  is thereby excluded all that has hitherto been looked upon as the higher
  aims of human life, such as the contemplation of truth. Not so, but by
  following the new aim we shall also arrive at a <i>true</i> knowledge of
  the universe in which we are, for without knowledge there is no power;
  truth and utility are in ultimate aspect the same; "works themselves are
  of greater value as pledges of truth than as contributing to the comforts
  of life."<a name="FnAnchor_1356"
  href="#Footnote_1356"><sup>[56]</sup></a> Such was the conception of
  philosophy with which Bacon started, and in which he felt himself to be
  thoroughly original. As his object was new and hitherto unproposed, so
  the method he intended to employ was different from all modes of
  investigation hitherto attempted. "It would be," as he says, "an unsound
  fancy and self-contradictory, to expect that things which have never yet
  been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357"><sup>[57]</sup></a> There were
  many obstacles in his way, and he seems always to have felt that the
  first part of the new scheme must be a <i>pars destruens</i>, a
  destructive criticism of all other methods. Opposition was to be
  expected, not only from previous philosophies, but especially from the
  human mind itself. In the first place, natural antagonism might be looked
  for from the two opposed sects, the one of whom, in despair of knowledge,
  maintained that all science was impossible; while the other, resting on
  authority and on the learning that had been handed down from the Greeks,
  declared that science was already completely known, and consequently
  devoted their energies to methodizing and elaborating it. Secondly,
  within the domain of science itself, properly so called, there were two
  "kind of rovers" who must be dismissed. The first were the speculative or
  logical philosophers, who construe the universe <i>ex analogia
  hominis</i>, and not <i>ex analogia mundi</i>, who fashion nature
  according to preconceived ideas, and who employ in their investigations
  syllogism and abstract reasoning. The second class, who were equally
  offensive, consisted of those who practised blind experience, which is
  mere <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[v.03
  p.0146]</span>groping in the dark (<i>vaga experientia mera palpatio
  est</i>), who occasionally hit upon good works or inventions, which, like
  Atalanta's apples, distracted them from further steady and gradual
  progress towards universal truth. In place of these straggling efforts of
  the unassisted human mind, a graduated system of helps was to be
  supplied, by the use of which the mind, when placed on the right road,
  would proceed with unerring and mechanical certainty to the invention of
  new arts and sciences.</p>

  <p>Such were to be the peculiar functions of the new method, though it
  has not definitely appeared what that method was, or to what objects it
  could be applied. But, before proceeding to unfold his method, Bacon
  found it necessary to enter in considerable detail upon the general
  subject of the obstacles to progress, and devoted nearly the whole of the
  first book of the <i>Organum</i> to the examination of them. This
  discussion, though strictly speaking extraneous to the scheme, has always
  been looked upon as a most important part of his philosophy, and his name
  is perhaps as much associated with the doctrine of Idols (<i>Idola</i>)
  as with the theory of induction or the classification of the
  sciences.</p>

  <p>The doctrine of the kinds of fallacies or general classes of errors
  into which the human mind is prone to fall, appears in many of the works
  written before the <i>Novum Organum</i>, and the treatment of them varies
  in some respects. The classification in the <i>Organum</i>, however, not
  only has the author's sanction, but has received the stamp of historical
  acceptation; and comparison of the earlier notices, though a point of
  literary interest, has no important philosophic bearing. The <i>Idola</i>
  (<i>Nov. Org.</i> i. 39)<a name="FnAnchor_1358"
  href="#Footnote_1358"><sup>[58]</sup></a> false notions of things, or
  erroneous ways of looking at nature, are of four kinds: the first two
  innate, pertaining to the very nature of the mind and not to be
  eradicated; the third creeping insensibly into men's minds, and hence in
  a sense innate and inseparable; the fourth imposed from without. The
  first kind are the <i>Idola Tribus</i>, idols of the tribe, fallacies
  incident to humanity or the race in general. Of these, the most prominent
  are&mdash;the proneness to suppose in nature greater order and regularity
  than there actually is; the tendency to support a preconceived opinion by
  affirmative instances, neglecting all negative or opposed cases; and the
  tendency to generalize from few observations, or to give reality to mere
  abstractions, figments of the mind. Manifold errors also result from the
  weakness of the senses, which affords scope for mere conjecture; from the
  influence exercised over the understanding by the will and passions; from
  the restless desire of the mind to penetrate to the ultimate principles
  of things; and from the belief that "man is the measure of the universe,"
  whereas, in truth, the world is received by us in a distorted and
  erroneous manner. The second kind are the <i>Idola Specus</i>, idols of
  the cave, or errors incident to the peculiar mental or bodily
  constitution of each individual, for according to the state of the
  individual's mind is his view of things. Errors of this class are
  innumerable, because there are numberless varieties of disposition; but
  some very prominent specimens can be indicated. Such are the tendency to
  make all things subservient to, or take the colour of some favourite
  subject, the extreme fondness and reverence either for what is ancient or
  for what is modern, and excess in noting either differences or
  resemblances amongst things. A practical rule for avoiding these is also
  given: "In general let every student of nature take this as a rule, that
  whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with particular satisfaction is
  to be held in suspicion."<a name="FnAnchor_1359"
  href="#Footnote_1359"><sup>[59]</sup></a> The third class are the
  <i>Idola Fori</i>, idols of the market-place, errors arising from the
  influence exercised over the mind by mere words. This, according to
  Bacon, is the most troublesome kind of error, and has been especially
  fatal in philosophy. For words introduce a fallacious mode of looking at
  things in two ways: first, there are some words that are really merely
  names for non-existent things, which are yet supposed to exist simply
  because they have received a name; secondly, there are names hastily and
  unskilfully abstracted from a few objects and applied recklessly to all
  that has the faintest analogy with these objects, thus causing the
  grossest confusion. The fourth and last class are the <i>Idola
  Theatri</i>, idols of the theatre, <i>i.e.</i> fallacious modes of
  thinking resulting from received systems of philosophy and from erroneous
  methods of demonstration. The criticism of the demonstrations is
  introduced later in close connexion with Bacon's new method; they are the
  rival modes of procedure, to which his own is definitely opposed. The
  philosophies which are "redargued" are divided into three classes, the
  sophistical, of which the best example is Aristotle, who, according to
  Bacon, forces nature into his abstract schemata and thinks to explain by
  definitions; the empirical, which from few and limited experiments leaps
  at once to general conclusions; and the superstitious, which corrupts
  philosophy by the introduction of poetical and theological notions.</p>

  <p>Such are the general causes of the errors that infest the human mind;
  by their exposure the way is cleared for the introduction of the new
  method. The nature of this method cannot be understood until it is
  exactly seen to what it is to be applied. What idea had Bacon of science,
  and how is his method connected with it? Now, the science<a
  name="FnAnchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360"><sup>[60]</sup></a> which was
  specially and invariably contemplated by him was natural philosophy, the
  great mother of all the sciences; it was to him the type of scientific
  knowledge, and its method was the method of all true science. To discover
  exactly the characteristics and the object of natural philosophy it is
  necessary to examine the place it holds in the general scheme furnished
  in the <i>Advancement</i> or <i>De Augmentis</i>. All human knowledge, it
  is there laid down, may be referred to man's memory or imagination or
  reason. In the first, the bare facts presented to sense are collected and
  stored up; the exposition of them is <i>history</i>, which is either
  natural or civil. In the second, the materials of sense are separated or
  divided in ways not corresponding to nature but after the mind's own
  pleasure, and the result is <i>poesy</i> or feigned history. In the
  third, the materials are worked up after the model or pattern of nature,
  though we are prone to err in the progress from sense to reason; the
  result is <i>philosophy</i>, which is concerned either with God, with
  nature or with man, the second being the most important. Natural
  philosophy is again divided into speculative or theoretical and operative
  or practical, according as the end is contemplation or works. Speculative
  or theoretical natural philosophy has to deal with natural substances and
  qualities and is subdivided into physics and metaphysics. Physics
  inquires into the efficient and material causes of things; metaphysics,
  into the formal and final causes. The principal objects of physics are
  concrete substances, or abstract though physical qualities. The research
  into abstract qualities, the fundamental problem of physics, comes near
  to the metaphysical study of <i>forms</i>, which indeed differs from the
  first only in being more general, and in having as its results a
  <i>form</i> strictly so called, <i>i.e.</i> a nature or quality which is
  a limitation or specific manifestation of some higher and better-known
  genus.<a name="FnAnchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
  Natural philosophy is, therefore, in ultimate resort the study of
  <i>forms</i>, and, consequently, the fundamental problem of philosophy in
  general is the discovery of these <i>forms</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On a given body to generate or superinduce a new nature or natures,
  is the work and aim of human power.... Of a given nature to discover the
  form or true specific difference, or nature-engendering nature (<i>natura
  naturans</i>) or source of emanation (for these are the terms which are
  nearest to a description of the thing), is the work and aim of human
  knowledge."<a name="FnAnchor_1362"
  href="#Footnote_1362"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The questions, then, whose answers give the key to the whole Baconian
  philosophy, may be put briefly thus&mdash;What are <!-- Page 147 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[v.03 p.0147]</span>forms? and how
  is it that knowledge of them solves both the theoretical and the
  practical problem of science? Bacon himself, as may be seen from the
  passage quoted above, finds great difficulty in giving an adequate and
  exact definition of what he means by a form. As a general description,
  the following passage from the <i>Novum Organum</i>, ii. 4, may be
  cited:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The form of a nature is such that given the form the nature
  infallibly follows.... Again, the form is such that if it be taken away
  the nature infallibly vanishes.... Lastly, the true form is such that it
  deduces the given nature from some source of being which is inherent in
  more natures, and which is better known in the natural order of things
  than the form itself."<a name="FnAnchor_1363"
  href="#Footnote_1363"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From this it would appear that, since by a <i>nature</i> is meant some
  sensible quality, superinduced upon, or possessed by, a body, so by a
  form we are to understand the cause of that nature, which cause is itself
  a determinate case or manifestation of some general or abstract quality
  inherent in a greater number of objects. But all these are mostly marks
  by which a form may be recognized, and do not explain what the form
  really is. A further definition is accordingly attempted in Aph.
  13:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The form of a thing is the very thing itself, and the thing differs
  from the form no otherwise than as the apparent differs from the real, or
  the external from the internal, or the thing in reference to the man from
  the thing in reference to the universe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This throws a new light on the question, and from it the inference at
  once follows, that the forms are the permanent causes or substances
  underlying all visible phenomena, which are merely manifestations of
  their activity. Are the forms, then, forces? At times it seems as if
  Bacon had approximated to this view of the nature of things, for in
  several passages he identifies forms with laws of activity. Thus, he
  says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When I speak of forms I mean nothing more than those laws and
  determinations of absolute actuality which govern and constitute any
  simple nature, as heat, light, weight, in every kind of matter and
  subject that is susceptible of them. Thus the form of heat or the form of
  light is the same thing as the law of heat or the law of light."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364"><sup>[64]</sup></a> "Matter
  rather than forms should be the object of our attention, its
  configurations and changes of configuration, and simple action, and law
  of action or motion; for forms are figments of the human mind, unless you
  will call those laws of action forms."<a name="FnAnchor_1365"
  href="#Footnote_1365"><sup>[65]</sup></a> "Forms or true differences of
  things, which are in fact laws of pure act."<a name="FnAnchor_1366"
  href="#Footnote_1366"><sup>[66]</sup></a> "For though in nature nothing
  really exists besides individual bodies, performing pure individual acts
  according to a fixed law, yet in philosophy this very law, and the
  investigation, discovery and explanation of it, is the foundation as well
  of knowledge as of operation. And it is this law, with its clauses, that
  I mean when I speak of forms."<a name="FnAnchor_1367"
  href="#Footnote_1367"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Several important conclusions may be drawn from these passages. In the
  first place, it is evident that Bacon, like the Atomical school, of whom
  he highly approved, had a clear perception and a firm grasp of the
  <i>physical</i> character of natural principles; his <i>forms</i> are no
  ideas or abstractions, but highly general physical properties. Further,
  it is hinted that these general qualities may be looked upon as the modes
  of action of simple bodies. This fruitful conception, however, Bacon does
  not work out; and though he uses the word <i>cause</i>, and identifies
  <i>form</i> with <i>formal cause</i>, yet it is perfectly apparent that
  the modern notions of cause as dynamical, and of nature as in a process
  of flow or development, are foreign to him, and that in his view of the
  ultimate problem of science, cause meant <i>causa immanens</i>, or
  underlying substance, effects were not consequents but manifestations,
  and nature was regarded in a purely statical aspect. That this is so
  appears even more clearly when we examine his general conception of the
  unity, gradation and function of the sciences. That the sciences are
  organically connected is a thought common to him and to his distinguished
  predecessor Roger Bacon. "I that hold it for a great impediment towards
  the advancement and further invention of knowledge, that particular arts
  and sciences have been disincorporated from general knowledge, do not
  understand one and the same thing which Cicero's discourse and the note
  and conceit of the Grecians in their word <i>circle learning</i> do
  intend. For I mean not that use which one science hath of another for
  ornament or help in practice; but I mean it directly of that use by way
  of supply of light and information, which the particulars and instances
  of one science do yield and present for the framing or correcting of the
  axioms of another science in their very truth and notion."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368"><sup>[68]</sup></a> In
  accordance with this, Bacon placed at the basis of the particular
  sciences which treat of God, nature and man, one fundamental doctrine,
  the <i>Prima Philosophia</i>, or first philosophy, the function of which
  was to display the unity of nature by connecting into one body of truth
  such of the highest axioms of the subordinate sciences as were not
  special to one science, but common to several.<a name="FnAnchor_1369"
  href="#Footnote_1369"><sup>[69]</sup></a> This first philosophy had also
  to investigate what are called the adventitious or transcendental
  conditions of essences, such as Much, Little, Like, Unlike, Possible,
  Impossible, Being, Nothing, the logical discussion of which certainly
  belonged rather to the laws of reasoning than to the existence of things,
  but the physical or real treatment of which might be expected to yield
  answers to such questions as, why certain substances are numerous, others
  scarce; or why, if like attracts like, iron does not attract iron.
  Following this summary philosophy come the sciences proper, rising like a
  pyramid in successive stages, the lowest floor being occupied by natural
  history or experience, the second by physics, the third, which is next
  the peak of unity, by metaphysics.<a name="FnAnchor_1370"
  href="#Footnote_1370"><sup>[70]</sup></a> The knowledge of the peak, or
  of the one law which binds nature together, is perhaps denied to man. Of
  the sciences, physics, as has been already seen, deals with the efficient
  and material, <i>i.e.</i> with the variable and transient, causes of
  things. But its inquiries may be directed either towards concrete bodies
  or towards abstract qualities. The first kind of investigation rises
  little above mere natural history; but the other is more important and
  paves the way for metaphysics. It handles the configurations and the
  appetites or motions of matter. The configurations, or inner structure of
  bodies, include dense, rare, heavy, light, hot, cold, &amp;c.,&mdash;in
  fact, what are elsewhere called simple natures. Motions<a
  name="FnAnchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371"><sup>[71]</sup></a> are either
  simple or compound, the latter being the sum of a number of the former.
  In physics, however, these matters are treated only as regards their
  material or efficient causes, and the result of inquiry into any one case
  gives no general rule, but only facilitates invention in some similar
  instance. Metaphysics, on the other hand, treats of the formal or final
  cause of<a name="FnAnchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
  these same substances and qualities, and results in a general rule. With
  regard to forms, the investigation may be directed either towards
  concrete bodies or towards qualities. But the forms of substances "are so
  perplexed and complicated, that it is either vain to inquire into them at
  all, or such inquiry as is possible should be put off for a time, and not
  entered upon till forms of a more simple nature have been rightly
  investigated and discussed."<a name="FnAnchor_1373"
  href="#Footnote_1373"><sup>[73]</sup></a> "To inquire into the form of a
  lion, of an oak, or gold, nay, even of water or air, is a vain pursuit;
  but to inquire the <i>form</i> of dense, rare, hot, cold, &amp;c., as
  well configurations as motions, which in treating of physic I have in
  <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[v.03
  p.0148]</span>great part enumerated (I call them forms of the first
  class), and which (like the letters of the alphabet) are not many, and
  yet make up and sustain the essences and forms of all
  substances&mdash;this, I say, it is which I am attempting, and which
  constitutes and defines that part of metaphysic of which we are now
  inquiring." Physics inquires into the same qualities, but does not push
  its investigations into ultimate reality or reach the more general
  causes. We thus at last attain a definite conclusion with regard to
  forms, and it appears clear that in Bacon's belief the true function of
  science was the search for a few fundamental physical qualities, highly
  abstract and general, the combinations of which give rise to the simple
  natures and complex phenomena around us. His general conception of the
  universe may therefore be called mechanical or statical; the cause of
  each phenomenon is supposed to be actually contained in the phenomenon
  itself, and by a sufficiently accurate process could be sifted out and
  brought to light. As soon as the causes are known man regains his power
  over nature, for "whosoever knows any form, knows also the utmost
  possibility of superinducing that nature upon every variety of matter,
  and so is less restrained and tied in operation either to the basis of
  the matter or to the condition of the efficients."<a name="FnAnchor_1374"
  href="#Footnote_1374"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Nature thus presented itself to Bacon's mind as a huge congeries of
  phenomena, the manifestations of some simple and primitive qualities,
  which were hid from us by the complexity of the things themselves. The
  world was a vast labyrinth, amid the windings of which we require some
  clue or thread whereby we may track our way to knowledge and thence to
  power. This thread, the <i>filum labyrinthi</i>, is the new method of
  <i>induction</i>. But, as has been frequently pointed out, the new method
  could not be applied until facts had been observed and collected. This is
  an indispensable preliminary. "Man, the servant and interpreter of
  nature, can do and understand so much, and so much only, as he has
  observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature; beyond this he
  neither knows anything nor can do anything." The proposition that our
  knowledge of nature necessarily begins with observation and experience,
  is common to Bacon and many contemporary reformers of science, but he
  laid peculiar stress upon it, and gave it a new meaning. What he really
  meant by observation was a competent natural history or collection of
  facts. "The firm foundations of a purer natural philosophy are laid in
  natural history."<a name="FnAnchor_1375"
  href="#Footnote_1375"><sup>[75]</sup></a> "First of all we must prepare a
  <i>natural and experimental history</i>, sufficient and good; and this is
  the foundation of all."<a name="FnAnchor_1376"
  href="#Footnote_1376"><sup>[76]</sup></a> The senses and the memory,
  which collect and store up facts, must be assisted; there must be a
  <i>ministration</i> of the senses and another of the memory. For not only
  are instances required, but these must be arranged in such a manner as
  not to distract or confuse the mind, <i>i.e.</i> tables and arrangements
  of instances must be constructed. In the preliminary collection the
  greatest care must be taken that the mind be absolutely free from
  preconceived ideas; nature is only to be conquered by obedience; man must
  be merely receptive. "All depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon
  the facts of nature, and so receiving their images simply as they are;
  for God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for
  a pattern of the world; rather may He graciously grant to us to write an
  apocalypse or true vision of the footsteps of the Creator imprinted on
  his creatures."<a name="FnAnchor_1377"
  href="#Footnote_1377"><sup>[77]</sup></a> Concealed among the facts
  presented to sense are the causes or forms, and the problem therefore is
  so to analyse experience<a name="FnAnchor_1378"
  href="#Footnote_1378"><sup>[78]</sup></a>, so to break it up into pieces,
  that we shall with certainty and mechanical ease arrive at a true
  conclusion. This process, which forms the essence of the new method, may
  in its entirety, as a ministration to the reason, be called a logic; but
  it differs widely from the ordinary or school logic in end, method and
  form. Its aim is to acquire command over nature by knowledge, and to
  invent new arts, whereas the old logic strove only after dialectic
  victories and the discovery of new arguments. In method the difference is
  even more fundamental. Hitherto the mode of demonstration had been by the
  syllogism; but the syllogism is, in many respects, an incompetent weapon.
  It is compelled to accept its first principles on trust from the science
  in which it is employed; it cannot cope with the subtlety of nature; and
  it is radically vitiated by being founded on hastily and inaccurately
  abstracted notions of things. For a syllogism consists of propositions,
  propositions of words, and words are the symbols of notions. Now the
  first step in accurate progress from sense to reason, or true philosophy,
  is to frame a <i>bona notio</i> or accurate conception of the thing; but
  the received logic never does this. It flies off at once from experience
  and particulars to the highest and most general propositions, and from
  these descends, by the use of middle terms, to axioms of lower
  generality. Such a mode of procedure may be called <i>anticipatio
  naturae</i> (for in it reason is allowed to prescribe to things), and is
  opposed to the true method, the <i>interpretatio naturae</i>, in which
  reason follows and obeys nature, discovering her secrets by obedience and
  submission to rule. Lastly, the very form of induction that has been used
  by logicians in the collection of their instances is a weak and useless
  thing. It is a mere enumeration of a few known facts, makes no use of
  exclusions or rejections, concludes precariously, and is always liable to
  be overthrown by a negative instance.<a name="FnAnchor_1379"
  href="#Footnote_1379"><sup>[79]</sup></a> In radical opposition to this
  method the Baconian induction begins by supplying helps and guides to the
  senses, whose unassisted information could not be relied on. Notions were
  formed carefully, and not till after a certain process of induction was
  completed.<a name="FnAnchor_1380"
  href="#Footnote_1380"><sup>[80]</sup></a> The formation of axioms was to
  be carried on by a gradually ascending scale. "Then and only then may we
  hope well of the sciences, when in a just scale of ascent and by
  successive steps, not interrupted or broken, we rise from particulars to
  lesser axioms; and then to middle axioms, one above the other; and last
  of all to the most general."<a name="FnAnchor_1381"
  href="#Footnote_1381"><sup>[81]</sup></a> Finally the very form of
  induction itself must be new. "The induction which is to be available for
  the discovery and demonstration of sciences and arts must analyse nature
  by proper rejections and exclusions; and then, after a sufficient number
  of negatives, come to a conclusion on the affirmative instances, which
  has not yet been done, or even attempted, save only by Plato.<a
  name="FnAnchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382"><sup>[82]</sup></a> ... And
  this induction must be used not only to discover axioms, but also in the
  formation of notions."<a name="FnAnchor_1383"
  href="#Footnote_1383"><sup>[83]</sup></a> This view of the function of
  exclusion is closely connected with Bacon's doctrine of forms, <!-- Page
  149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>[v.03
  p.0149]</span>and is in fact dependent upon that theory. But induction is
  neither the whole of the new method, nor is it applicable to forms only.
  There are two other grand objects of inquiry: the one, the transformation
  of concrete bodies; the other, the investigation of the latent powers and
  the latent schematism or configuration. With regard to the first, in
  ultimate result it depends upon the theory of forms; for whenever the
  compound body can be regarded as the sum of certain simple natures, then
  our knowledge of the forms of these natures gives us the power of
  superinducing a new nature on the concrete body. As regards the latent
  process (<i>latens processus</i>) which goes on in all cases of
  generation and continuous development or motion, we examine carefully,
  and by quantitative measurements, the gradual growth and change from the
  first elements to the completed thing. The same kind of investigation may
  be extended to many cases of natural motion, such as voluntary action or
  nutrition; and though inquiry is here directed towards concrete bodies,
  and does not therefore penetrate so deeply into reality as in research
  for forms, yet great results may be looked for with more confidence. It
  is to be regretted that Bacon did not complete this portion of his work,
  in which for the first time he approaches modern conceptions of change.
  The latent configuration (<i>latens schematismus</i>) or inward structure
  of the parts of a body must be known before we can hope to superinduce a
  new nature upon it. This can only be discovered by analysis, which will
  disclose the ultimate constituents (natural particles, not atoms) of
  bodies, and lead back the discussion to forms or simple natures, whereby
  alone can true light be thrown on these obscure questions. Thus, in all
  cases, scientific explanation depends upon knowledge of forms; all
  phenomena or secondary qualities are accounted for by being referred to
  the primary qualities of matter.</p>

  <p>The several steps in the inductive investigation of the form of any
  nature flow readily from the definition of the form itself. For that is
  always and necessarily present when the nature is present, absent when it
  is absent, decreases and increases according as the nature decreases and
  increases. It is therefore requisite for the inquiry to have before us
  instances in which the nature is present. The list of these is called the
  table of <i>Essence and Presence</i>. Secondly, we must have instances in
  which the nature is absent; only as such cases might be infinite,
  attention should be limited to such of them as are most akin to the
  instances of presence.<a name="FnAnchor_1384"
  href="#Footnote_1384"><sup>[84]</sup></a> The list in this case is called
  table of <i>Absence in Proximity</i>. Thirdly, we must have a number of
  instances in which the nature is present in different degrees, either
  increasing or decreasing in the same subject, or variously present in
  different subjects. This is the table of <i>Degrees</i>, or
  <i>Comparison</i>. After the formation of these tables, we proceed to
  apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, and
  that in which the author took most pride, the process of exclusion or
  rejection. This elimination of the non-essential, grounded on the
  fundamental propositions with regard to forms, is the most important of
  Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he
  repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies. It is
  evident that if the tables were complete, and our notions of the
  respective phenomena clear, the process of exclusion would be a merely
  mechanical <i>counting out</i>, and would <i>infallibly</i> lead to the
  detection of the cause or form. But it is just as evident that these
  conditions can never be adequately fulfilled. Bacon saw that his method
  was impracticable (though he seems to have thought the difficulties not
  insuperable), and therefore set to work to devise new helps,
  <i>adminicula</i>. These he enumerates in ii., <i>Aph.</i>
  21:&mdash;<i>Prerogative Instances, Supports of Induction, Rectification
  of Induction, Varying the Investigation according to the Nature of the
  Subject, Prerogative Natures, Limits of Investigation, Application to
  Practice, Preparations for Investigation, the Ascending and Descending
  Scale of Axioms</i>. The remainder of the <i>Organum</i> is devoted to a
  consideration of the twenty-seven classes of Prerogative Instances, and
  though it contains much that is both luminous and helpful, it adds little
  to our knowledge of what constitutes the Baconian method. On the other
  heads we have but a few scattered hints. But although the rigorous
  requirements of science could only be fulfilled by the employment of all
  these means, yet in their absence it was permissible to draw from the
  tables and the exclusion a hypothetical conclusion, the truth of which
  might be verified by the use of the other processes; such an hypothesis
  is called fantastically the First Vintage (<i>Vindemiatio</i>). The
  inductive method, so far as exhibited in the <i>Organum</i>, is
  exemplified by an investigation into the nature of heat.</p>

  <p>Such was the method devised by Bacon, and to which he ascribed the
  qualities of absolute certainty and mechanical simplicity. But even
  supposing that this method were accurate and completely unfolded, it is
  evident that it could only be made applicable and produce fruit when the
  phenomena of the universe have been very completely tabulated and
  arranged. In this demand for a complete natural history, Bacon also felt
  that he was original, and he was deeply impressed with the necessity for
  it;<a name="FnAnchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385"><sup>[85]</sup></a> in
  fact, he seems occasionally to place an even higher value upon it than
  upon his <i>Organum</i>. Thus, in the preface to his series of works
  forming the third part of the <i>Instauratio</i>, he says: "It comes,
  therefore, to this, that my <i>Organum</i>, even if it were completed,
  would not without the <i>Natural History</i> much advance the
  <i>Instauration of the Sciences</i>, whereas the <i>Natural History</i>
  without the <i>Organum</i> would advance it not a little."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386"><sup>[86]</sup></a> But a
  complete natural history is evidently a thing impossible, and in fact a
  history can only be collected by attending to the requirements of the
  <i>Organum</i>. This was seen by Bacon, and what may be regarded as his
  final opinion on the question is given in the important letter to Jean
  Antoine Baranzano<a name="FnAnchor_1387"
  href="#Footnote_1387"><sup>[87]</sup></a> ("Redemptus":
  1590-1622):&mdash;"With regard to the multitude of instances by which men
  may be deterred from the attempt, here is my answer. First, what need to
  dissemble? Either store of instances must be procured, or the business
  must be given up. All other ways, however enticing, are impassable.
  Secondly, the prerogatives of instances, and the mode of experimenting
  upon experiments of light (which I shall hereafter explain), will
  diminish the multitude of them very much. Thirdly, what matter, I ask, if
  the description of the instances should fill six times as many volumes as
  Pliny's <i>History</i>? ... For the true natural history is to take
  nothing except instances, connections, observations and canons."<a
  name="FnAnchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388"><sup>[88]</sup></a> The
  <i>Organum</i> and the <i>History</i> are thus correlative, and form the
  two equally necessary sides of a true philosophy; by their union the new
  philosophy is produced.</p>

  <p><i>Summary.</i>&mdash;Two questions may be put to any doctrine which
  professes to effect a radical change in philosophy or science. Is it
  original? Is it valuable? With regard to the first, it has been already
  pointed out that Bacon's induction or inductive method is distinctly his
  own, though it cannot and need not be maintained that the general spirit
  of his philosophy was entirely new.<a name="FnAnchor_1389"
  href="#Footnote_1389"><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The value of the method is the separate and more difficult question.
  It has been assailed on the most opposite grounds. Macaulay, while
  admitting the accuracy of the process, denied its efficiency, on the
  ground that an operation performed naturally was not rendered more easy
  or efficacious by being subjected to analysis.<a name="FnAnchor_1390"
  href="#Footnote_1390"><sup>[90]</sup></a> This objection is curious when
  confronted with Bacon's reiterated assertion that the <i>natural</i>
  method pursued by the unassisted human reason is distinctly opposed to
  his; and it is besides an argument that tells so strongly against many
  sciences, as to be comparatively worthless when applied to any one. There
  are, however, more formidable objections against the method. It has been
  pointed out,<a name="FnAnchor_1391"
  href="#Footnote_1391"><sup>[91]</sup></a> and with perfect justice, <!--
  Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>[v.03
  p.0150]</span>that science in its progress has not followed the Baconian
  method, that no one discovery can be pointed to which can be definitely
  ascribed to the use of his rules, and that men the most celebrated for
  their scientific acquirements, while paying homage to the name of Bacon,
  practically set at naught his most cherished precepts. The reason of this
  is not far to seek, and has been pointed out by logicians of the most
  diametrically opposed schools. The mechanical character both of the
  natural history and of the logical method applied to it resulted
  necessarily from Bacon's radically false conception of the nature of
  cause and of the causal relation. The whole logical or scientific problem
  is treated as if it were one of co-existence, to which in truth the
  method of exclusion is scarcely applicable, and the assumption is
  constantly made that each phenomenon has one and only one cause.<a
  name="FnAnchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392"><sup>[92]</sup></a> The
  inductive formation of axioms by a gradually ascending scale is a route
  which no science has ever followed, and by which no science could ever
  make progress. The true scientific procedure is by hypothesis followed up
  and tested by verification; the most powerful instrument is the deductive
  method, which Bacon can hardly be said to have recognized. The power of
  framing hypothesis points to another want in the Baconian doctrine. If
  that power form part of the true method, then the mind is not wholly
  passive or recipient; it anticipates nature, and moulds the experience
  received by it in accordance with its own constructive ideas or
  conceptions; and yet further, the minds of various investigators can
  never be reduced to the same dead mechanical level.<a
  name="FnAnchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393"><sup>[93]</sup></a> There will
  still be room for the scientific use of the imagination and for the
  creative flashes of genius.<a name="FnAnchor_1394"
  href="#Footnote_1394"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If, then, Bacon himself made no contributions to science, if no
  discovery can be shown to be due to the use of his rules, if his method
  be logically defective, and the problem to which it was applied one from
  its nature incapable of adequate solution, it may not unreasonably be
  asked, How has he come to be looked upon as the great leader in the
  reformation of modern science? How is it that he shares with Descartes
  the honour of inaugurating modern philosophy? To this the true answer
  seems to be that Bacon owes his position not only to the general spirit
  of his philosophy, but to the manner in which he worked into a connected
  system the new mode of thinking, and to the incomparable power and
  eloquence with which he expounded and enforced it. Like all epoch-making
  works, the <i>Novum Organum</i> gave expression to ideas which were
  already beginning to be in the air. The time was ripe for a great change;
  scholasticism, long decaying, had begun to fall; the authority not only
  of school doctrines but of the church had been discarded; while here and
  there a few devoted experimenters were turning with fresh zeal to the
  unwithered face of nature. The fruitful thoughts which lay under and gave
  rise to these scattered efforts of the human mind, were gathered up into
  unity, and reduced to system in the new philosophy of Bacon.<a
  name="FnAnchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395"><sup>[95]</sup></a> It is
  assuredly little matter for wonder that this philosophy should contain
  much that is now inapplicable, and that in many respects it should be
  vitiated by radical errors. The details of the logical method on which
  its author laid the greatest stress have not been found of practical
  service;<a name="FnAnchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396"><sup>[96]</sup></a>
  yet the fundamental ideas on which the theory rested, the need for
  rejecting rash generalization, and the necessity for a critical analysis
  of experience, are as true and valuable now as they were then. Progress
  in scientific discovery is made mainly, if not solely, by the employment
  of hypothesis, and for that no code of rules can be laid down such as
  Bacon had devised. Yet the framing of hypothesis is no mere random
  guesswork; it is left not to the imagination alone, but to the
  <i>scientific imagination</i>. There is required in the process not
  merely a preliminary critical induction, but a subsequent experimental
  comparison, verification or proof, the canons of which can be laid down
  with precision. To formulate and show grounds for these laws is to
  construct a philosophy of induction, and it must not be forgotten that
  the first step towards the accomplishment of the task was made by Bacon
  when he introduced and gave prominence to the powerful logical instrument
  of exclusion or elimination.</p>

  <p>It is curious and significant that in the domain of the moral and
  metaphysical sciences his influence has been perhaps more powerful, and
  his authority has been more frequently appealed to, than in that of the
  physical. This is due, not so much to his expressed opinion that the
  inductive method was applicable to all the sciences,<a
  name="FnAnchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397"><sup>[97]</sup></a> as to the
  generally practical, or, one may say, <!-- Page 151 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>[v.03 p.0151]</span><i>positive</i>
  spirit of his system. Theological questions, which had tortured the minds
  of generations, are by him relegated from the province of reason to that
  of faith. Even reason must be restrained from striving after ultimate
  truth; it is one of the errors of the human intellect that it will not
  rest in general principles, but must push its investigations deeper.
  Experience and observation are the only remedies against prejudice and
  error. Into questions of metaphysics, as commonly understood, Bacon can
  hardly be said to have entered, but a long line of thinkers have drawn
  inspiration from him, and it is not without justice that he has been
  looked upon as the originator and guiding spirit of what is known as the
  empirical school.</p>

  <p><i>Bacon's Influence.</i>&mdash;It is impossible within our limits to
  do more than indicate the influence which Bacon's views have had on
  subsequent thinkers. The most valuable and complete discussion of the
  subject is contained in T. Fowler's edition of the <i>Novum Organum</i>
  (introd. § 14). It is there argued that, both in philosophy and in
  natural science, Bacon's influence was immediate and lasting. Under the
  former head it is pointed out (i.) that the fundamental principle of
  Locke's <i>Essay</i>, that all our ideas are product of sensation and
  reflection, is briefly stated in the first aphorism of the <i>Novum
  Organum</i>, and (ii.) that the whole atmosphere of that treatise is
  characteristic of the <i>Essay</i>. Bacon is, therefore, regarded by many
  as the father of what is most characteristic in English psychological
  speculation. As he himself said, he "rang the bell which called the wits
  together." In the sphere of ethics he is similarly regarded as a
  forerunner of the empirical method. The spirit of the <i>De Augmentis</i>
  (bk. vii.) and the inductive method which is discussed in the <i>Novum
  Organum</i> are at the root of all theories which have constructed a
  moral code by an inductive examination of human consciousness and the
  results of actions. Among such theories utilitarianism especially is the
  natural result of the application to the phenomenon of conduct of the
  Baconian experimental method. In this connexion, however, it is important
  to notice that Hobbes, who had been Bacon's secretary, makes no mention
  of Baconian induction, nor does he in any of his works make any critical
  reference to Bacon himself. It would, therefore, appear that Bacon's
  influence was not immediate.</p>

  <p>In the sphere of natural science, Bacon's importance is attested by
  references to his work in the writings of the principal scientists, not
  only English, but French, German and Italian. Fowler (<i>op. cit.</i>)
  has collected from Descartes, Gassendi, S. Sorbière, Jean Baptiste du
  Hamel, quotations which show how highly Bacon was regarded by the leaders
  of the new scientific movement. Sorbière, who was by no means partial to
  things English, definitely speaks of him as "celuy qui a le plus
  puissamment solicité les interests de la physique, et excité le monde à
  faire des expériences" (<i>Relation d'un voyage en Angleterre</i>,
  Cologne, 1666, pp. 63-64). It was, however, Voltaire and the
  encyclopaedists who raised Bacon to the pinnacle of his fame in France,
  and hailed him as "le père de la philosophie expérimentale" (<i>Lettres
  sur les Anglois</i>). Condillac, in the same spirit, says of him,
  "personne n'a mieux connu que lui la cause de nos erreurs." So the
  <i>Encyclopédie</i>, besides giving a eulogistic article "Baconisme,"
  speaks of him (in d'Alembert's preliminary discourse) as "le plus grand,
  le plus universel, et le plus éloquent des philosophes." Among other
  writers, Leibnitz and Huygens give testimony which is the more valuable
  as being critical. Leibnitz speaks of Bacon as "divini ingenii vir," and,
  like several other German authors, classes him with Campanella; Huygens
  refers to his "bonnes méthodes." If, however, we are to attach weight to
  English writers of the latter half of the 17th century, we shall find
  that one of Bacon's greatest achievements was the impetus given by his
  <i>New Atlantis</i> to the foundation of the Royal Society (<i>q.v.</i>).
  Dr Thomas Sprat (1635-1713), bishop of Rochester and first historian of
  the society, says that Bacon of all others "had the true imagination of
  the whole extent" of the enterprise, and that in his works are to be
  found the best arguments for the experimental method of natural
  philosophy (<i>Hist. of the Royal Society</i>, pp. 35-36, and Thomas
  Tenison's <i>Baconiana</i>, pp. 264-266). In this connexion reference
  should be made also to Cowley's <i>Ode to the Royal Society</i>, and to
  Dr John Wallis's remarks in Hearne's <i>Preface to P. Langtoft's
  Chronicle</i> (appendix, num. xi.). Joseph Glanvill, in his <i>Scepsis
  Scientifica</i> (dedication) says, "Solomon's house in the <i>New
  Atlantis</i> was a prophetic scheme of the Royal Society"; and Henry
  Oldenburg (<i>c.</i> 1615-1677), one of the first secretaries of the
  society, speaks of the new eagerness to obtain scientific data as "a work
  begun by the single care and conduct of the excellent Lord Verulam."
  Boyle, in whose works there are frequent eulogistic references to Bacon,
  regarded himself as a disciple and was indeed known as a second Bacon.
  The predominating influence of Bacon's philosophy is thus clearly
  established in the generation which succeeded his own. There is abundant
  evidence to show that in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
  (especially the latter) the new spirit had already modified the old
  curricula. Bacon has frequently been disparaged on the ground that his
  name is not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton. It can be shown, however, that
  Newton was not ignorant of Bacon's works, and Dr Fowler explains his
  silence with regard to them on three grounds: (1) that Bacon's reputation
  was so well established that any definite mention was unnecessary, (2)
  that it was not customary at the time to acknowledge indebtedness to
  contemporary and recent writers, and (3) that Newton's genius was so
  strongly mathematical (whereas Bacon's great weakness was in mathematics)
  that he had no special reason to refer to Bacon's experimental
  principles.</p>

  <p>If the foregoing examples are held sufficient to establish the
  influence of Bacon on the intellectual development of his immediate
  successors, it follows that the whole trend of typically English thought,
  not only in natural science, but also in mental, moral and political
  philosophy, is the logical fulfilment of Baconian principles. He argued
  against the tyranny of authority, the vagaries of unfettered imagination
  and the academic aims of unpractical dialectic; the vital energy and the
  reasoned optimism of his language entirely outweigh the fact that his
  contributions to the stock of actual scientific knowledge were
  practically inconsiderable. It may be freely admitted that in the domain
  of logic there is nothing in the <i>Organum</i> that has not been more
  instructively analysed either by Aristotle himself or in modern works; at
  the same time, there is probably no work which is a better and more
  stimulating introduction to logical study. Its terse, epigrammatic
  phrases sink into the fibre of the mind, and are a healthy warning
  against crude, immature generalization.</p>

  <p>While, therefore, it is a profound mistake to regard Bacon as a great
  constructive philosopher, or even as a lonely pioneer of modern thought,
  it is quite unfair to speak of him as a trifler. His great work consists
  in the fact that he summed up the faults which the widening of knowledge
  had disclosed in medieval thought, and in this sense he stands high among
  those who were in many parts of 16th-century Europe striving towards a
  new intellectual activity.</p>

  accuse myself that I am either prodigal or slothful, yet my health is not
  to spend, nor my course to get. Lastly, I confess that I have as vast
  contemplative ends as I have moderate civil ends; for I have taken all
  knowledge to be my province; and if I could purge it of two sorts of
  rovers, whereof the one with frivolous disputations, confutations and
  verbosities, the other with blind experiments and auricular traditions
  and impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in
  industrious observations, grounded conclusions and profitable inventions
  and discoveries&mdash;the best state of that province. This, whether it
  be curiosity, or vain-glory, or nature, or (if one take it favourably)
  <i>philanthropia</i>, is so fixed in my mind as it cannot be removed. And
  I do easily see, that place of any reasonable commandment doth bring
  commandment of more wits than of a man's own.</p>

  <p>And if your lordship shall find now, or at any time, that I do seek or
  affect any place whereunto any that is nearer to your lordship shall be
  convenient, say then that I am a most dishonest man. And if your lordship
  will not carry me on,... this I will do, I will sell the inheritance that
  I have, and purchase some lease of quick revenue, or some office of gain
  that shall be executed by deputy, and so give over all care of service,
  and become some sorry bookmaker, or a true pioneer in that mine of
  truth."&mdash;Spedding, <i>Letters and Life</i>, i. 108-109.</p>

  <p><a name="Footnote_1345" href="#FnAnchor_1345">[45]</a> Not only do the
  cases, so far as they are known, support Bacon's plea of innocence, but
  it is remarkable that no attempt at a reversal of any of his numerous

  should not have been overturned. See <i>Letters and Life</i>, vii.

  <p><a name="Footnote_1346" href="#FnAnchor_1346">[46]</a> The
  peculiarities of Bacon's style were noticed very early by his
  contemporaries. (See <i>Letters and Life</i>, i. 268.) Raleigh and Jonson
  have both recorded their opinions of it, but no one has characterized it
  more happily than his friend, Sir Tobie Matthews, "A man so rare in
  knowledge, of so many several kinds, endued with the facility and
  felicity of expressing it all in so elegant, significant, so abundant,
  and yet so choice and ravishing a way of words, of metaphors, of
  allusions, as perhaps the world hath not seen since it was a
  world."&mdash;"Address to the Reader" prefixed to <i>Collection of
  English Letters</i> (1660).</p>

  <p><a name="Footnote_1347" href="#FnAnchor_1347">[47]</a> The division of
  the sciences adopted in the great French <i>Encyclopédie</i> was founded
  upon this classification of Bacon's. See Diderot's <i>Prospectus
  (&OElig;uvres</i>, iii.) and d'Alembert's <i>Discours (&OElig;uvres</i>,
  i.) The scheme should be compared with later attempts of the same nature
  by Ampère, Cournot, Comte and Herbert Spencer.</p>

  <i>N.&nbsp;O.</i> ii. 27. Bacon nowhere enters upon the questions of how such
  a science is to be constructed, and how it can be expected to possess an
  independent method while it remains the mere receptacle for the
  generalizations of the several sciences, and consequently has a content
  which varies with their progress. His whole conception of <i>Prima
  Philosophia</i> should be compared with such a modern work as the
  <i>First Principles</i> of Herbert Spencer.</p>

  <p><a name="Footnote_1370" href="#FnAnchor_1370">[70]</a> It is to be

  <p><a name="Footnote_1372" href="#FnAnchor_1372">[72]</a> The knowledge
  of final causes does not lead to works, and the consideration of them
  must be rigidly excluded from physics. Yet there is no opposition between
  the physical and final causes; in ultimate resort the mind is compelled
  to think the universe as the work of reason, to refer facts to God and
  Providence. The idea of final cause is also fruitful in sciences which
  have to do with human action. (Cf. <i>De Aug.</i> iii. cc. 4, 5; <i>Nov.

  <p><a name="Footnote_1379" href="#FnAnchor_1379">[79]</a> Bacon's summary
  is valuable. "In the whole of the process which leads from the senses and
  objects to axioms and conclusions, the demonstrations which we use are
  deceptive and incompetent. The process consists of four parts, and has as
  many faults. In the first place, the impressions of the sense itself are
  faulty, for the sense both fails us and deceives us. But its shortcomings
  are to be supplied and its deceptions to be corrected. Secondly, notions
  are all drawn from the impressions of the sense, and are indefinite and
  confused, whereas they should be definite and distinctly bounded.
  Thirdly, the induction is amiss which infers the principles of sciences
  by simple enumeration, and does not, as it ought, employ exclusions and
  solutions (or separations) of nature. Lastly, that method of discovery
  and proof according to which the most general principles are first
  established, and then intermediate axioms are tried and proved by them,
  is the parent of error and the curse of all science."&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;O.</i>

  used a method somewhat akin to his own; but it has frequently been
  contended that his induction is nothing more than the <span
  title="epagôgê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F71;&gamma;&omega;&gamma;&eta;</span> of Aristotle (see
  Rémusat's <i>Bacon, &amp;c.</i>, pp. 310-315, and for a criticism,
  Waddington, <i>Essais de Logique</i>, p. 261. sqq.) This seems a mistake.
  Bacon did not understand by induction the argument from particulars to a
  general proposition; he looked upon the exclusion and rejection, or upon
  <i>elimination</i>, as the essence of induction. To this process he was
  led by his doctrine of forms, of which it is the necessary consequence;
  it is the infallible result of his view of science and its problem, and
  is as original as that is. Whoever accepts Bacon's doctrine of cause must
  accept at the same time his theory of the way in which the cause may be
  sifted out from among the phenomena. It is evident that the Socratic
  search for the essence by an analysis of instances&mdash;an induction
  ending in a definition&mdash;has a strong resemblance to the Baconian
  inductive method.</p>

  Lasson, <i>Über Bacon von Verulam's wissenschaftliche Principien</i>
  (1860); Liebig, <i>Über Francis Bacon von Verulam</i>, &amp;c. (1863).
  Although Liebig points out how little science proceeds according to
  Bacon's rules, yet his other criticisms seem of extremely little value.
  In a very offensive and quite unjustifiable tone, which is severely
  commented on by Sigwart and Fischer, he attacks the Baconian methods and
  its results. These results he claims to find in the <i>Sylva
  Sylvarum</i>, entirely ignoring what Bacon himself has said of the nature
  of that work (<i>N.&nbsp;O.</i> i. 117; cf. Rawley's Pref. to the
  <i>S.&nbsp;S.</i>), and thus putting a false interpretation on the experiments
  there noted. It is not surprising that he should detect many flaws, but
  he never fails to exaggerate an error, and seems sometimes completely to
  miss the point of what Bacon says. (See particularly his remarks on
  <i>S.&nbsp;S.</i> 33, 336.) The method he explains in such a way as to show he
  has not a glimpse of its true nature. He brings against Bacon, of all
  men, the accusations of making induction start from the undetermined
  perceptions of the senses, of using imagination, and of putting a quite
  arbitrary interpretation on phenomena. He crowns his criticism by
  expounding what he considers to be the true scientific method, which, as
  has been pointed put by Fischer, is simply that Baconian doctrine against
  which his attack ought to have been directed. (See his account of the
  method, <i>Über Bacon</i>, 47-49; K. Fischer, <i>Bacon</i>, pp. 499-502.)

  <p><a name="Footnote_1394" href="#FnAnchor_1394">[94]</a> Although it
  must be admitted that the Baconian method is fairly open to the
  above-mentioned objections, it is curious and significant that Bacon was
  not thoroughly ignorant of them, but with deliberate consciousness
  preferred his own method. We do not think, indeed, that the
  <i>notiones</i> of which he speaks in any way correspond to what Whewell
  and Ellis would call "conceptions or ideas furnished by the mind of the
  thinker"; nor do we imagine that Bacon would have admitted these as
  necessary elements in the inductive process. But he was certainly not
  ignorant of what may be called a deductive method, and of a kind of
  hypothesis. This is clear from the use he makes of the
  <i>Vindemiatio</i>, from certain hints as to the testing of axioms, from
  his admission of the syllogism into physical reasoning, and from what he
  calls <i>Experientia Literata</i>. The function of the <i>Vindemiatio</i>
  has been already pointed out; with regard to axioms, he says
  (<i>N.&nbsp;O.</i> i. 106), "In establishing axioms by this kind of induction,
  we must also examine and try whether the axiom so established be framed
  to the measure of these particulars, from which it is derived, or whether
  it be larger or wider. And if it be larger and wider, we must observe
  whether, by indicating to us new particulars, it confirm that wideness
  and largeness as by a collateral security, that we may not either stick
  fast in things already known, or loosely grasp at shadows and abstract
  forms, not at things solid and realized in matter." (Cf. also the passage
  from <i>Valerius Terminus</i>, quoted in Ellis's note on the above
  aphorism.) Of the syllogism he says, "I do not propose to give up the
  syllogism altogether. S. is incompetent for the principal things rather
  than useless for the generality. In the mathematics there is no reason
  why it should not be employed. It is the flux of matter and the
  inconstancy of the physical body which requires induction, that thereby
  it may be fixed as it were, and allow the formation of notions well
  defined. In physics you wisely note, and therein I agree with you, that
  after the notions of the first class and the axioms concerning them have
  been by induction well made out and defined, syllogism may be applied
  safely; only it must be restrained from leaping at once to the most
  general notions, and progress must be made through a fit succession of
  steps."&mdash;("Letter to Baranzano," <i>Letters and Life</i>, vii. 377).
  And with this may be compared what he says of mathematics (<i>Nov.
  Org.</i> ii. 8; <i>Parasceve</i>, vii.). In his account of <i>Experientia
  Literata</i> (<i>De Aug.</i> v. 2) he comes very near to the modern mode
  of experimental research. It is, he says, the procedure from one
  experiment to another, and it is not a science but an art or learned
  sagacity (resembling in this Aristotle's <span title="anchinoia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&gamma;&chi;&#x1F77;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;</span>), which
  may, however, be enlightened by the precepts of the <i>Interpretatio</i>.
  Eight varieties of such experiments are enumerated, and a comparison is
  drawn between this and the inductive method; "though the rational method
  of inquiry by the Organon promises far greater things in the end, yet
  this sagacity, proceeding by learned experience, will in the meantime
  present mankind with a number of inventions which lie near at hand." (Cf.
  <i>N.&nbsp;O.</i> i. 103.)</p>

  <p><b>BACON, JOHN</b> (1740-1799), British sculptor, was born in
  Southwark on the 24th of November 1740, the son of Thomas Bacon, a
  cloth-worker, whose forefathers possessed a considerable estate in
  Somersetshire. At the age of fourteen he was bound apprentice in Mr
  Crispe's manufactory of porcelain at Lambeth, where he was at first
  employed in painting the small ornamental pieces of china, but by his
  great skill in moulding he soon attained the distinction of being
  modeller to the work. While engaged in the porcelain works his
  observation of the models executed by different sculptors of eminence,
  which were sent to be burned at an adjoining pottery, determined the
  direction of his genius; he devoted himself to the imitation of them with
  so much success that in 1758 a small figure of Peace sent by him to the
  Society for the Encouragement of Arts received a prize, and the highest
  premiums given by that society were adjudged to him nine times between
  the years 1763 and 1776. During his apprenticeship he also improved the
  method of working statues in artificial stone, an art which he afterwards
  carried to perfection. Bacon first attempted working in marble about the
  year 1763, and during the course of his early efforts in this art was led
  to improve the method of transferring the form of the model to the marble
  (technically "getting out the points") by the invention of a more perfect
  instrument for the purpose. This instrument possessed many advantages
  above those formerly employed; it was more exact, took a correct
  measurement in every direction, was contained in a small compass, and
  could be used upon either the model or the marble. In the year 1769 he
  was adjudged the first gold medal for sculpture given by the Royal
  Academy, his work being a bas-relief representing the escape of Aeneas
  from Troy. In 1770 he exhibited a figure of Mars, which gained him the
  gold medal of the Society of Arts and his election as A.R.A. As a
  consequence of this success he was engaged to execute a bust of George
  III., intended for Christ Church, Oxford. He secured the king's favour
  and retained it throughout life. Considerable jealousy was entertained
  against him by other sculptors, and he was commonly charged with
  ignorance of classic style. This charge he repelled by the execution of a
  noble head of Jupiter Tonans, and many of his emblematical figures are in
  perfect classical taste. He died on the 4th of August 1799 and was buried
  in Whitfield's Tabernacle. His various productions which may be studied
  in St Paul's cathedral, London, Christ Church and Pembroke College,
  Oxford, the Abbey church, Bath, and Bristol cathedral, give ample
  testimony to his powers. Perhaps his best works are to be found among the
  monuments in Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p><b>BACON, LEONARD</b> (1802-1881), American Congregational preacher
  and writer, was born in Detroit, Michigan, on the 19th of February 1802,
  the son of David Bacon (1771-1817), missionary among the Indians in
  Michigan and founder of the town of Tallmadge, Ohio. The son prepared for
  college at the Hartford (Conn.) grammar school, graduated at Yale in 1820
  and at the Andover Theological Seminary in 1823, and from 1825 until his
  death on the 24th of December 1881 was pastor of the First Church
  (Congregational) in New Haven, Connecticut, occupying a pulpit which was
  one of the most conspicuous in New England, and which had been rendered
  famous by his predecessors, Moses Stuart and Nathaniel W. Taylor. In
  1866, however, though he was never dismissed by a council from his
  connexion with that church, he gave up the active pastorate. He was, from
  1826 to 1838, an editor of the <i>Christian Spectator</i> (New Haven);
  was one of the founders (1843) of the <i>New Englander</i> (later the
  <i>Yale Review</i>); founded in 1848 with Dr R.&nbsp;S. Storrs, Joshua
  Leavitt, Dr Joseph P. Thompson and Henry C. Bowen, primarily to combat
  slavery extension, the <i>Independent</i>, of which he was an editor
  until 1863; and was acting professor of didactic theology in the
  theological department of Yale University from 1866 to 1871, and lecturer
  on church polity and American church history from 1871 until his death.
  Gradually, after taking up his pastorate, he gained greater and greater
  influence in his denomination, until he came to be regarded as perhaps
  the most prominent Congregationalist of his time, and was sometimes
  popularly referred to as "The Congregational Pope of New England." In all
  the heated theological controversies of the day, particularly the long
  and bitter one concerning the views put forward by Dr Horace Bushnell, he
  was conspicuous, using his influence to bring about harmony, and in the
  councils of the Congregational churches, over two of which, the Brooklyn
  councils of 1874 and 1876, he presided as moderator, he manifested great
  ability both as a debater and as a parliamentarian. In his own
  theological views he was broad-minded and an advocate of liberal
  orthodoxy. In all matters concerning the welfare of his community or the
  nation, moreover, he took a deep and constant interest, and was
  particularly identified with the temperance and anti-slavery movements,
  his services to the latter constituting probably the most important work
  of his life. In this, as in most other controversies, he took a moderate
  course, condemning the apologists and defenders of slavery on the one
  hand and the Garrisonian extremists on the other. His <i>Slavery
  Discussed in Occasional Essays from 1833 to 1846</i> (1846) exercised
  considerable influence upon Abraham Lincoln, and in this book appears the
  sentence, which, as rephrased by Lincoln, was widely quoted: "If that
  form of government, that system of social order is not wrong&mdash;if
  those laws of the Southern States, by virtue of which slavery exists
  there, and is what it is, are not wrong&mdash;nothing is wrong." He was
  early attracted to the study of the ecclesiastical history of New England
  and was frequently called upon to deliver commemorative addresses, some
  of which were published in book and pamphlet form. Of these, his
  <i>Thirteen Historical Discourses</i> (1839), dealing with the history of
  New Haven, and his <i>Four Commemorative Discourses</i> (1866) may be
  especially mentioned. The most important of his historical works,
  however, is his <i>Genesis of the New England Churches</i> (1874). He
  published <i>A Manual for Young Church Members</i> (1833); edited, with a
  biography, the <i>Select Practical Writings of Richard Baxter</i> (1831);
  and was the author of a number of hymns, the best-known of which is the
  one beginning,</p>

  <p>There is no good biography, but there is much biographical material in
  the commemorative volume issued by his congregation, <i>Leonard Bacon,
  Pastor of the First Church in New Haven</i> (New Haven, 1882), and there
  is a good sketch in Williston Walker's <i>Ten New England Leaders</i>

  <p>Leonard Bacon's sister <span class="sc">Delia Bacon</span>
  (1811-1859), born in Tallmadge, Ohio, on the 2nd of February 1811, was a
  teacher in schools in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and then,
  until about 1852, conducted in various eastern cities, by methods devised
  by herself, classes for women in history and literature. She wrote
  <i>Tales of the Puritans</i> (1831), <i>The Bride of Fort Edward</i>
  (1839), based on the story of Jane M<sup>c</sup>Crea, partly in blank
  verse, and <i>The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded</i>
  (1857), for which alone she is remembered. This book, in the preparation
  of which she spent several years in study in England, where she was
  befriended by Thomas Carlyle and especially by Nathaniel Hawthorne, was
  intended to prove that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were written
  by a coterie of men, including Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh and
  Edmund Spenser, for the purpose of inculcating a philosophic system, for
  which they felt that they themselves could not afford to assume the
  responsibility. This system she professed to discover beneath the
  superficial text of the plays. Her devotion to this one idea, as
  Hawthorne says, "had thrown her off her balance," and while she was in
  England she lost her mind entirely. She died in Hartford, Connecticut, on
  the 2nd of September 1859.</p>

  <p><b>BACON, SIR NICHOLAS</b> (1509-1579), lord keeper of the great seal
  of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was the second son of
  Robert Bacon of Drinkstone, Suffolk, and was born at Chislehurst. He was
  educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1527,
  and afterwards spent some time in Paris. Having returned to England and
  entered Gray's Inn, he was called to the bar in 1533, and four years
  later began his public life as solicitor of the court of augmentations.
  Quickly becoming a person of importance he obtained a number of estates,
  principally in the eastern counties, after the dissolution of the
  monasteries, and in 1545 became member of parliament for Dartmouth. In
  1546 he was made attorney of the court of wards and liveries, an office
  of both honour and profit; in 1550 became a bencher and in 1552 treasurer
  of Gray's Inn. Although his sympathies were with the Protestants, he
  retained his office in the court of wards during Mary's reign, but an
  order was issued to prevent him from leaving England. The important
  period in Bacon's life began with the accession of Elizabeth in 1558.
  Owing largely to his long and close friendship with Sir William Cecil,
  afterwards Lord Burghley, his brother-in-law, he was appointed lord
  keeper of the great seal in December of this year, and was soon
  afterwards made a privy councillor and a knight. He was instrumental in
  securing the archbishopric of Canterbury for his friend Matthew Parker,
  and in his official capacity presided over the House of Lords when
  Elizabeth opened her first parliament. In opposition to Cecil, he
  objected to the policy of making war on France in the interests of the
  enemies of Mary queen of Scots, on the ground of the poverty of England;
  but afterwards favoured a closer union with foreign Protestants, and
  seemed quite alive to the danger to his country from the allied and
  aggressive religious policy of France and Scotland. In 1559 he was
  authorized to exercise the full jurisdiction of lord chancellor. In 1564
  he fell temporarily into the royal disfavour and was dismissed from
  court, because Elizabeth suspected he was concerned in the publication of
  a pamphlet, "A Declaration of the Succession of the Crowne Imperiall of
  Ingland," written by John Hales (<i>q.v.</i>), and favouring the claim of
  Lady Catherine Grey to the English throne. Bacon's innocence having been
  admitted he was restored to favour, and replied to a writing by Sir
  Anthony Browne, who had again asserted the rights of the house of Suffolk
  to which Lady Catherine belonged. He thoroughly distrusted Mary queen of
  Scots; objected to the proposal to marry her to the duke of Norfolk; and
  warned Elizabeth that serious consequences for England would follow her
  restoration. He seems to have disliked the proposed marriage between the
  English queen and Francis, duke of Anjou, and his distrust of the Roman
  Catholics and the French was increased by the massacre of St Bartholomew.
  As a loyal English churchman he was ceaselessly interested in
  ecclesiastical matters, and made suggestions for the better observation
  of doctrine and discipline in the church. He died in London on the 20th
  of February 1579 and was buried in St Paul's cathedral, his death calling
  forth many tributes to his memory. He was an eloquent speaker, a learned
  lawyer, a generous friend; and his interest in education led him to make
  several gifts and bequests for educational purposes, including the
  foundation of a free grammar school at Redgrave. His figure was very
  corpulent and ungainly. Elizabeth visited him several times at
  Gorhambury, and had previously visited him at Redgrave. He was twice
  married and by his first wife, Jane, had three sons and three daughters.
  His second wife was Anne (d. 1610), daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, by
  whom he had two sons. Bacon's eldest son, Nicholas (<i>c.</i> 1540-1624),
  was member of parliament for the county of Suffolk and in 1611 was
  created premier baronet of England. This baronetcy is still held by his
  descendants. His second and third sons, Nathaniel (<i>c.</i> 1550-1622)
  and Edward (<i>c.</i> 1550-1618), also took some part in public life, and
  through his daughter, Anne, Nathaniel was an ancestor of the marquesses
  Townshend. His sons by his second wife were Anthony (1558-1601), a
  diplomatist of some repute, and the illustrious Francis Bacon
  (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

  <p>See G. Whetstone, "Remembraunce of the life of Sir N. Bacon," in the
  <i>Frondes Caducae</i> (London, 1816); J.&nbsp;A. Froude, <i>History of
  England</i>, passim (London, 1881 f.).</p>

  <p><b>BACON, ROGER</b> (<i>c.</i> 1214-<i>c.</i> 1294), English
  philosopher and man of science, was born near Ilchester in Somerset. His
  family appears to have been in good circumstances, but in the stormy
  reign of Henry III. their property was despoiled and several members of
  the family were driven into exile. Roger completed his studies at Oxford,
  though not, as current traditions assert, at Merton or at Brasenose,
  neither of which had then been founded. His abilities were speedily
  recognized by his contemporaries, and he enjoyed the friendship of such
  eminent men as Adam de Marisco and Robert Grosseteste, bishop of
  Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Very little is known of Bacon's life at Oxford; it is said he took
  orders in 1233, and this is not improbable. In the following year, or
  perhaps later, he crossed over to France and studied at the university of
  Paris, then the centre of intellectual life in Europe. The two great
  orders, Franciscans and Dominicans, were in the vigour of youth, and had
  already begun to take the lead in theological discussion. Alexander of
  Hales was the oracle of the Franciscans, while the rival order rejoiced
  in Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.</p>

  <p>The scientific training which Bacon had received, mainly from the
  study of the Arab writers, showed him the manifold defects in the systems
  reared by these doctors. Aristotle was known but in part, and that part
  was rendered well-nigh unintelligible through the vileness of the
  translations; yet not one of those professors would learn Greek. The
  Scriptures read, if at all, in the erroneous versions were being deserted
  for the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard. Physical science, if there was
  anything deserving that name, was cultivated, not by experiment in the
  Aristotelian way, but by arguments deduced from premises resting on
  authority or custom. Everywhere there was a show of knowledge concealing
  fundamental ignorance. Bacon, accordingly, withdrew from the scholastic
  routine and devoted himself to languages and experimental research. The
  only teacher whom he respected was a certain Petrus de Maharncuria
  Picardus, or of Picardy, probably identical with a certain mathematician,
  Petrus Peregrinus of Picardy, who is perhaps the author of a MS.
  treatise, <i>De Magnete</i>, contained in the Bibliothèque Impériale at
  Paris. The contrast between the obscurity of such a man and <!-- Page 154
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>[v.03 p.0154]</span>the
  fame enjoyed by the fluent young doctors roused Bacon's indignation. In
  the <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i> he pours forth a violent
  tirade against Alexander of Hales, and another professor, not mentioned
  by name, but spoken of as alive, and blamed even more severely than
  Alexander. This anonymous writer,<a name="FnAnchor_141"
  href="#Footnote_141"><sup>[1]</sup></a> he says, acquired his learning by
  teaching others, and adopted a dogmatic tone, which has caused him to be
  received at Paris with applause as the equal of Aristotle, Avicenna, or
  Averroes.</p>

  <p>Bacon, during his stay in Paris, acquired considerable renown. He took
  the degree of doctor of theology, and seems to have received the
  complimentary title of <i>doctor mirabilis</i>. In 1250 he was again at
  Oxford, and probably about this time entered the Franciscan order. His
  fame spread at Oxford, though it was mingled with suspicions of his
  dealings in the black arts and with some doubts of his orthodoxy. About
  1257, Bonaventura, general of the order, interdicted his lectures at
  Oxford, and commanded him to place himself under the superintendence of
  the body at Paris. Here for ten years he remained under supervision,
  suffering great privations and strictly prohibited from writing anything
  for publication. But his fame had reached the ears of the papal legate in
  England, Guy de Foulques, who in 1265 became pope as Clement IV. In the
  following year he wrote to Bacon, ordering him notwithstanding any
  injunctions from his superiors, to write out and send to him a treatise
  on the sciences which he had already asked of him when papal legate.
  Bacon, whose previous writings had been mostly scattered tracts,
  <i>capitula quaedam</i>, took fresh courage from this command of the
  pope. He set at naught the jealousy of his superiors and brother friars,
  and despite the want of funds, instruments, materials for copying and
  skilled copyists, completed in about eighteen months three large
  treatises, the <i>Opus Majus</i>, <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus
  Tertium</i>, which, with some other tracts, were despatched to the pope.
  We do not know what opinion Clement formed of them, but before his death
  he seems to have bestirred himself on Bacon's behalf, for in 1268 the
  latter was permitted to return to Oxford. Here he continued his labours
  in experimental science and also in the composition of complete
  treatises. The works sent to Clement he regarded as preliminaries, laying
  down principles which were afterwards to be applied to the sciences. The
  first part of an encyclopaedic work probably remains to us in the
  <i>Compendium Studii Philosophiae</i> (1271). In this work Bacon makes a
  vehement attack upon the ignorance and vices of the clergy and monks, and
  generally upon the insufficiency of the existing studies. In 1278 his
  books were condemned by Jerome de Ascoli, general of the Franciscans,
  afterwards Pope Nicholas IV., and he himself was thrown into prison for
  fourteen years. During this time, it is said, he wrote the small tract
  <i>De Retardandis Senectutis Accidentibus</i>, but this is merely a
  tradition. In 1292, as appears from what is probably his latest
  composition, the <i>Compendium Studii Theologiae</i>, he was again at
  liberty. The exact time of his death cannot be determined; 1294 is
  probably as accurate a date as can be fixed upon.</p>

  <p><i>Works and Editions</i>.&mdash;Leland said that it is easier to
  collect the leaves of the Sibyl than the titles of the works written by
  Roger Bacon; and though the labour has been somewhat lightened by the
  publications of Brewer and Charles, referred to below, it is no easy
  matter even now to form an accurate idea of his actual productions. An
  enormous number of MSS. are known to exist in British and French
  libraries, and probably not all have yet been discovered. Many are
  transcripts of works or portions of works already published and,
  therefore, require no notice.<a name="FnAnchor_142"
  href="#Footnote_142"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The works hitherto printed (neglecting reprints) are the
  following:&mdash;(1) <i>Speculum Alchimiae</i> (1541)&mdash;translated
  into English (1597); French, A Poisson (1890); (2) <i>De Mirabili
  Potestate Artis et Naturae</i> (1542)&mdash;English translation (1659);
  (3) <i>Libellus de Retardandis Senectutis Accidentibus</i>
  (1590)&mdash;translated as the "Cure of Old Age," by Richard Brown
  (London, 1683); (4) <i>Sanioris Medicinae Magistri D. Rogeri Baconis
  Anglici de Arte Chymiae Scripta</i> (Frankfort, 1603)&mdash;a collection
  of small tracts containing <i>Excerpta de Libra Avicennae de Anima</i>,
  <i>Breve Breviarium</i>, <i>Verbum Abbreviatum,</i><a name="FnAnchor_143"
  href="#Footnote_143"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <i>Secretum Secretorum</i>,
  <i>Tractatus Trium Verborum</i>, and <i>Speculum Secretorum</i>; (5)
  <i>Perspectiva</i> (1614), which is the fifth part of the <i>Opus
  Majus</i>; (6) <i>Specula Mathematica</i>, which is the fourth part of
  the same; (7) <i>Opus Majus ad Clementem IV.</i>, edited by S. Jebb
  (1733) and J.&nbsp;H. Bridges (London, 1897); (8) <i>Opera hactenus
  Inedita</i>, by J.&nbsp;S. Brewer (1859), containing the <i>Opus Tertium</i>,
  <i>Opus Minus</i>, <i>Compendium Studii Philosophiae</i> and the <i>De
  Secretis Operibus Naturae</i>; (9) <i>De Morali Philosophia</i> (Dublin,
  1860, see below); (10) <i>The Greek Grammar of R. Bacon and a Fragment of
  his Hebrew Grammar</i>, edited with introduction and notes by E.&nbsp;S. Nolan
  and S.&nbsp;A. Hirsch (1902); (11) <i>Metaphysica Fratris Rogeri</i>, edited
  by R. Steele, with a preface (1905); (12) <i>Opera hactenus inedita</i>,
  by Robert Steele (1905).</p>

  <p>How these works stand related to one another can only be determined by
  internal evidence. The smaller works, chiefly on alchemy, are
  unimportant, and the dates of their composition cannot be ascertained. It
  is known that before the <i>Opus Majus</i> Bacon had already written some
  tracts, among which an unpublished work, <i>Computus Naturalium</i>, on
  chronology, belongs probably to the year 1263; while, if the dedication
  of the <i>De Secretis Operibus</i> be authentic, that short treatise must
  have been composed before 1249.</p>

  <p>It is, however, with the <i>Opus Majus</i> that Bacon's real activity
  begins. It has been called by Whewell at once the Encyclopaedia and the
  Organum of the 13th century.</p>

  <p>Part I. (pp. 1-22), which is sometimes designated <i>De Utililate
  Scientiarum</i>, treats of the four <i>offendicula</i>, or causes of
  error. These are, authority, custom, the opinion of the unskilled many,
  and the concealment of real ignorance with pretence of knowledge. The
  last error is the most dangerous, and is, in a sense, the cause of all
  the others. The <i>offendicula</i> have sometimes been looked upon as an
  anticipation of Francis Bacon's <i>Idola</i>, but the two classifications
  have little in common. In the summary of this part, contained in the
  <i>Opus Tertium</i>, Bacon shows very clearly his perception of the unity
  of science and the necessity of encyclopaedic treatment.</p>

  <p>Part II. (pp. 23-43) treats of the relation between philosophy and
  theology. All true wisdom is contained in the Scriptures, at least
  implicitly; and the true end of philosophy is to rise from the imperfect
  knowledge of created things to a knowledge of the Creator. Ancient
  philosophers, who had not the Scriptures, received direct illumination
  from God, and only thus can the brilliant results attained by them be
  accounted for.</p>

  <p>Part III. (pp. 44-57) treats of the utility of grammar, and the
  necessity of a true linguistic science for the adequate comprehension
  either of the Scriptures or of books on philosophy. <!-- Page 155
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>[v.03 p.0155]</span>The
  necessity of accurate acquaintance with any foreign language and of
  obtaining good texts, is a subject Bacon is never weary of descanting
  upon. A translator should know thoroughly the language he is translating
  from, the language into which he is translating, and the subject of which
  the book treats.</p>

  <p>Part IV. (pp. 57-255) contains an elaborate treatise on mathematics,
  "the alphabet of philosophy," maintaining that all the sciences rest
  ultimately on mathematics, and progress only when their facts can be
  subsumed under mathematical principles. This fruitful thought he
  illustrates by showing how geometry is applied to the action of natural
  bodies, and demonstrating by geometrical figures certain laws of physical
  forces. He also shows how his method may be used to determine some
  curious and long-discussed problems, such as the light of the stars, the
  ebb and flow of the tide, the motion of the balance. He then proceeds to
  adduce elaborate and sometimes slightly grotesque reasons tending to
  prove that mathematical knowledge is essential in theology, and closes
  this section of his work with two comprehensive sketches of geography and
  astronomy. That on geography is particularly good, and is interesting as
  having been read by Columbus, who lighted on it in Petrus de Alliaco's
  <i>Imago Mundi</i>, and was strongly influenced by its reasoning.</p>

  <p>Part V. (pp. 256-357) treats of perspective. This was the part of his
  work on which Bacon most prided himself, and in it, we may add, he seems
  to owe most to the Arab writers Kindi and Alhazen. The treatise opens
  with an able sketch of psychology, founded upon, but in some important
  respects varying from, Aristotle's <i>De Anima</i>. The anatomy of the
  eye is next described; this is done well and evidently at first hand,
  though the functions of the parts are not given with complete accuracy.
  Many other points of physiological optics are touched on, in general
  erroneously. Bacon then discusses vision in a right line, the laws of
  reflection and refraction, and the construction of mirrors and lenses. In
  this part of the work, as in the preceding, his reasoning depends
  essentially upon his peculiar view of natural agents and their
  activities. His fundamental physical maxims are matter and force; the
  latter he calls <i>virtus</i>, <i>species</i>, <i>imago agentis</i>, and
  by numberless other names. Change, or any natural phenomenon, is produced
  by the impression of a virtus or species on matter&mdash;the result being
  the thing known. Physical action is, therefore, <i>impression</i>, or
  transmission of force in lines, and must accordingly be explained
  geometrically. This view of nature Bacon considered fundamental, and it
  lies, indeed, at the root of his whole philosophy. To the short notices
  of it given in the 4th and 5th parts of the <i>Opus Majus</i>, he
  subjoined two, or perhaps three, extended accounts of it. We possess at
  least one of these in the tract <i>De Multiplicatione Specierum</i>,
  printed as part of the <i>Opus Majus</i> by Jebb (pp. 358-444). We cannot
  do more than refer to Charles for discussions as to how this theory of
  nature is connected with the metaphysical problems of force and matter,
  with the logical doctrine of universals, and in general with Bacon's
  theory of knowledge.</p>

  <p>Part VI. (pp. 445-477) treats of experimental science, <i>domina
  omnium scientiarum</i>. There are two methods of knowledge: the one by
  argument, the other by experience. Mere argument is never sufficient; it
  may decide a question, but gives no satisfaction or certainty to the
  mind, which can only be convinced by immediate inspection or intuition.
  Now this is what experience gives. But experience is of two sorts,
  external and internal; the first is that usually called experiment, but
  it can give no complete knowledge even of corporeal things, much less of
  spiritual. On the other hand, in inner experience the mind is illuminated
  by the divine truth, and of this supernatural enlightenment there are
  seven grades.</p>

  <p>Experimental science, which in the <i>Opus Tertium</i> (p. 46) is
  distinguished from the speculative sciences and the operative arts in a
  way that forcibly reminds us of Francis Bacon, is said to have three
  great prerogatives over all other sciences:&mdash;(1) It verifies their
  conclusions by direct experiment; (2) It discovers truths which they
  could never reach; (3) It investigates the secrets of nature, and opens
  to us a knowledge of past and future. As an instance of his method, Bacon
  gives an investigation into the nature and cause of the rainbow, which is
  really a very fine specimen of inductive research.</p>

  <p>The seventh part of the <i>Opus Majus</i> (<i>De Morali
  Philosophia</i>), not given in Jebb's edition, is noticed at considerable
  length in the <i>Opus Tertium</i> (cap. xiv.). Extracts from it are given
  by Charles (pp. 339-348).</p>

  <p>As has been seen, Bacon had no sooner finished this elaborate work
  than he began to prepare a summary to be sent along with it. Of this
  summary, or <i>Opus Minus</i>, part has come down and is published in
  Brewer's <i>Op. Ined.</i> (313-389), from what appears to be the only MS.
  The work was intended to contain an abstract of the <i>Opus Majus</i>, an
  account of the principal vices of theology, and treatises on speculative
  and practical alchemy. At the same time, or immediately after, Bacon
  began a third work as a preamble to the other two, giving their general
  scope and aim, but supplementing them in many points. The part of this
  work, generally called <i>Opus Tertium</i>, is printed by Brewer (pp.
  1-310), who considers it to be a complete treatise. Charles, however, has
  given good grounds for supposing that it is merely a preface, and that
  the work went on to discuss grammar, logic (which Bacon thought of little
  service, as reasoning was innate), mathematics, general physics,
  metaphysics and moral philosophy. He founds his argument mainly on
  passages in the <i>Communia Naturalium</i>, which indeed prove distinctly
  that it was sent to Clement, and cannot, therefore, form part of the
  <i>Compendium</i>, as Brewer seems to think. It must be confessed,
  however, that nothing can well be more confusing than the references in
  Bacon's works, and it seems well-nigh hopeless to attempt a complete
  arrangement of them until the texts have been collated and carefully
  printed.</p>

  <p>All these large works Bacon appears to have looked on as
  preliminaries, introductions, leading to a great work which should
  embrace the principles of all the sciences. This great work, which is
  perhaps the frequently-referred-to <i>Liber Sex Scientiarum</i>, he
  began, and a few fragments still indicate its outline. First appears to
  have come the treatise now called <i>Compendium Studii Philosophiae</i>
  (Brewer pp. 393-519), containing an account of the causes of error, and
  then entering at length upon grammar. After that, apparently, logic was
  to be treated; then, possibly, mathematics and physics; then speculative
  alchemy and experimental science. It is, however, very difficult, in the
  present state of our knowledge of the MSS., to hazard even conjectures as
  to the contents and nature of this last and most comprehensive work.</p>

  <p>Bacon's fame in popular estimation has always rested on his mechanical
  discoveries. Careful research has shown that very little can with
  accuracy be ascribed to him. He certainly describes a method of
  constructing a telescope, but not so as to lead one to conclude that he
  was in possession of that instrument. Burning-glasses were in common use,
  and spectacles it does not appear he made, although he was probably
  acquainted with the principle of their construction. His wonderful
  predictions (in the <i>De Secretis</i>) must be taken <i>cum grano
  salis</i>; he believed in astrology, in the doctrine of signatures, and
  in the philosopher's stone, and <i>knew</i> that the circle had been
  squared. For his work in connexion with gunpowder, the invention of which
  has been claimed for him on the ground of a passage in his <i>De mirabili
  potestate artis et naturae</i>, see <span
  class="sc">Gunpowder</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Summary.</i>&mdash;The 13th century, an age peculiarly rich in
  great men, produced few, if any, who can take higher rank than Roger
  Bacon. He is in every way worthy to be placed beside Albertus Magnus,
  Bonaventura, and Thomas Aquinas. These had an infinitely wider renown in
  their day, but modern criticism has restored the balance in his favour,
  and is even in danger of erring in the opposite direction. Bacon, it is
  now said, was not appreciated by his age because he was in advance of it;
  he is no schoolman, but a modern thinker, whose conceptions of science
  are more just and clear than are even those of his more celebrated
  namesake.<a name="FnAnchor_144" href="#Footnote_144"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
  In this view there is certainly some truth, but it is much exaggerated.
  As a general rule, no man can be completely dissevered from his national
  antecedents and <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>[v.03 p.0156]</span>surroundings, and Bacon is not an
  exception. Those who take up such an extreme position regarding his
  merits have known too little of the state of contemporary science, and
  have limited their comparison to the works of the scholastic theologians.
  We never find in Bacon himself any consciousness of originality; he is
  rather a keen and systematic thinker, working in a well-beaten track,
  from which his contemporaries were being drawn by theology and
  metaphysics.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The best work on Roger
  Bacon is perhaps that of E. Charles, <i>Roger Bacon, sa vie, ses
  ouvrages, ses doctrines d'après des textes inédits</i> (1861). Against
  the somewhat enthusiastic estimate and modern interpretation given in
  this work, are Schneider in his <i>Roger Bacon, Eine Monographie</i>
  (Augsburg, 1873); K. Werner, <i>Die Psychol. ... des Roger Bacon</i> and
  <i>Die Kosmologie ... des Roger Bacon</i> (Vienna, 1879); S.&nbsp;A. Hirsch,
  <i>Early English Hebraists</i> (1899); <i>Book of Essays</i> (London,
  1905), deals with Bacon as a Hebraist. The new matter contained in the
  publications of Charles and Brewer was summarized by H. Siebert, <i>Roger
  Bacon: Inaugural Dissertation</i> (Marburg, 1861). Cf. also J.&nbsp;K. Ingram,

  <p><a name="Footnote_141" href="#FnAnchor_141">[1]</a> Brewer thinks this
  unknown professor is Richard of Cornwall, but the little we know of
  Richard is not in harmony with the terms in which he is elsewhere spoken
  of by Bacon. Erdmann conjectures Thomas Aquinas, which is extremely
  improbable, as Thomas was unquestionably not the first of his order to
  study philosophy. Cousin and Charles think that Albertus Magnus is aimed
  at, and certainly much of what is said applies with peculiar force to
  him. But some things do not at all cohere with what is otherwise known of
  Albert. It is worth pointing out that Brewer, in transcribing the passage
  bearing on this (<i>Op. Ined.</i> p. 327), has the words <i>fratrum
  puerulus</i>, which in his marginal note he interprets as applying to the
  Franciscan order. In this case, of course, Albert could not be the person
  referred to, as he was a Dominican. But Charles, in his transcription,
  entirely omits the important word <i>fratrum</i>. </p>
